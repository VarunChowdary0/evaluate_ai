      "text": "Hard skills and Soft skills:\nHard skills are the technical skills that are gained by experience and knowledge in a domain. They are like the soft skills, i.e., the non-technical, communication and interpersonal skills. They define how you behave with other people. In software industries and other domains, soft skills play an important role to develop one's career. The soft skills are gained by observing other people and practices learned from people.\n\nDistinction & Soft skill for Engineering Students:\nThe soft skills are important for engineering students. The student needs proper behaviour, communication and interpersonal skills. These will help the student to adapt his/her future. Soft skills will help the student to properly deal with faculty and superiors, also to be a leader and manage the teams. Students are required to pursue and improve new features and proper posture while sitting or standing. When a student is attending class, he should use his soft skills properly to be with the class, take discussions actively and maintain proper sitting posture. This helps to express his feelings. Main goal of soft skills: This helps to achieve and determine the students' goals. Also it clears doubts.\n\nSoft skills of a team-leader Engineering student:\nEngineering students will have many activities and projects. Hence, soft skills play a significant role since students live and work together as a team. A team leader should have proper leadership qualities which are soft skills. He should be able to manage and co-ordinate, guide the team. The team members should also co-operate with each other.",

      "question": "“We never get a second chance to make the first impression.” Do you agree or disagree? Why? Support this statement with an example.",
      "text": "We never get a second chance to make the first impression.\nYes, I do agree with the statement. We never get a second chance to make a first impression. As the statement implies, because the first impression is the initial opinion about a person made when we look at a person and it is made based on their dress, face, verbal and non-verbal actions, etc. Once the first impression is made, we cannot get a second chance to change how people perceive or understand about us.\n\nExample:\nLet us consider an interview. In this example, let a good person go to the same interview. The first person is clean, proper, accurate, neat, cheerful, and properly greets the interviewer. He is doing this activity to make a good first impression. Even if the person is not good, by taking an opinion that he is good.\nThe second person going to the same interview without proper dress (e.g., a T-shirt) and colored hair, wearing slippery shoes and long beard. He just feels irritated by the interviewer even after greeting or asking for permits. This activity will give a bad impression about the second person. The interviewer will conclude that the person is unsuitable for the company's working environment.\n\nConclusion:\nYes, there are no second chances to change the first impression. As we can see in the example, the first person makes a good impression. And the second person will make a bad first impression. Even though the second person is more skillful and experienced in the role, the interviewer will only select the first person due to the first impression he made.",

Interpersonal communication is comprised of two major skills:\n1. Verbal Communication Skills: In verbal communication, we use words, vocabulary, and grammar to show our ideas and thoughts.\n2. Non-Verbal Communication Skills: In non-verbal communication, we use body language, gestures, eye contact, sitting posture, and facial expressions, etc., to express our feelings and thoughts.\n\nProductive and Self-Fulfilling Interpersonal Communication:\nA productive interpersonal communication needs both verbal and non-verbal communication. They should work together to make a more self-fulfilling and productive interpersonal communication.\n\nSelf-fulfillment in Interpersonal Communication:\nWhen do we feel the communication is productive and fulfilled? By listening to other people's body language, how they respond, and how they understand each person, we can observe the signals and the actions of people. Interpersonal communication determines its productivity and self-fulfillment.\n\nExample:\nLet us consider a classroom activity where people are arguing (or discussing) physics. The students interact, ask doubts, and actively participate in the classroom activity. Then the teacher can conclude that the class is productive and self-fulfilled.",

      "question": "Interpret the importance of learning speech sounds of english language for fluent and confident communication. Why is the lack of the aforementioned a problem?",
      "text": "Importance of Learning Speech Sounds of English language for Fluent and Confident Communication:\nThe speech sounds are the basic blocks of any language. We combine these speech sounds to make meaningful words. Hence, it is important that speech sounds are used properly while communicating and speaking words. The speech sounds will help to increase fluency and communication confidence. Suppose you are in a group discussion. Now you have the valuable point to share (because you can sense the topic and arguments). But after seeing how others participate in group discussions, their speaking and how they pronounce, your confidence will come down. It makes your point stand up in the group discussion to meet your point. So, speech sounds help to motivate people and focus on learning the proper accent. This will improve their fluent and confident communication.\n\nWhat happens if a person lacks proper speech sounds?\nIf a person lacks English speech sounds, he could not properly pronounce the word or mispronounce. Ultimately, he/she will lack the confidence to converse in the English language. This will affect the fluency in the language. Hence, the lack of English speech sounds is a problem that leads to less confidence and panic attacks.",

      "text": "Mother Tongue Influence:\nMother tongue is a verbal communication problem commonly seen in communities where English language is not their mother tongue or first language. Mother Tongue Influence is related to pronunciation problems, i.e., people pronounce the English words as they pronounce in their mother tongue.\n\nEffect of Mother Tongue on Fluency:\nMother tongue in fluency causes verbal communication delays and misinterpretation. Due to mother tongue influence, people mispronounce words. It makes it hard for others to understand. Sometimes they might misinterpret the word for its literal meaning. Mother tongue influence can be reduced by practicing English speech sounds and practicing proper accent.\n\nExamples:\nHere are examples from my mother tongue that influence spoken communication:\nMother Tongue Language (Telugu)\n1. Tongue which is pronounced as Teunge (Actual pronunciation: Tounge)\n2. Which is pronounced as Esculu (Actual pronunciation: Eskoolu, for School)\n3.

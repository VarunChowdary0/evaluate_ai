      "text": "Differentiation between Verification and Validation (V&V) in the context of Software Testing.\nVerification is the content of Quality Assurance Testing. Verification refers to 'how we are doing it', rather than 'what we are doing'. In Verification, we check if we are doing it correctly according to the client's requirements, and if what we are doing is meeting the requirements of the client. We check that we are doing what the client asked and what we planned.\nValidation in Software Testing implies that what we did is correct or not, checking for mistakes, finding bugs, and validating based on client specifications. Validation means what we are doing overall is correct according to the client's specifications. Continuously check for any bug and defect in the developed product.\nNow, let's see the V-Model and how in each phase the differences are addressed.\n[Diagram of V-Model with Verification activities (Requirements Analysis, System Design, Architecture Design, Module Design, Coding) on the left side, and Validation activities (Acceptance Test, System Test, Integration Test, Unit Test) on the right side, with arrows connecting corresponding phases across the V.]\nIn Verification and Validation, the V-Model design (planning) and validation (testing) are done parallelly. The defects in design can be found in early stages, preventing costly changes later.\nIn Verification, the requirements are analyzed and validated in Acceptance Testing. And the assumptions and understanding of requirements are checked.\nIn the next phase, System design, the system flow and control flow are checked and tested in System Testing.\nArchitectural design is tested using Integration testing, to check if the modules are interacting properly.\nModule design is tested using Unit testing, which includes functional logic and reliability tests.\nIn Software Testing, Verification and Validation are two different but go hand in hand. This results in an important proactive check for the reactive check.\n\nTest Automation:\nIn modern Software Testing, manual testing alone is not practical. So, software are developed using tools to test. Tools for test automation, performance testing, and also for validation. These tools help us to do our work efficiently while minimizing mistakes. Test automation plays an important role in our modern Software Testing activities. They help automate the repetitive tasks and improve accuracy. Test Automation can easily improve the test coverage and help to minimize testing errors. Not all tests can be automated, but test automation is time-saving and needs skilled people when we develop automated tests. And the automated tests keep changing and evolving according to the UI changes. There are many automation tools available in the market to make the testing reliable and efficient. Automation tools: Selenium, JUnit, Jira, React Test, etc.",

      "question": "What are the primary objectives of software testing? Discuss how testing contributes to software reliability and customer satisfaction. [BL: Understand| CO: 1|Marks: 7]",
      "text": "Primary Objectives of Software Testing\nSoftware testing is done to check functional and non-functional requirements of a Software Product and verify if it is able to satisfy the client's specifications. There are some Primary objectives of Software Testing:\n1. Validate the client's specifications.\n2. Find bugs and defective modules.\n3. Conform with the client's requirements.\n4. Improve Software Reliability.\n5. Enhance the usability and operability of the software.\n6. Identify the threshold or breaking point of the software.\n7. Minimize the error rate during product production.\n8. Implement Quality Assurance policies.\n9. Fix and retest bugs during the testing phase.\n\nThe Main Objective of Software Testing is to ensure that the Software product is robust, reliable, efficient and finally meets the client's requirements and standards while maintaining the product quality.\nHere are some Software testing activities that are used to complete the Testing Objectives:\n1. Test Planning: Identify scope, strategies, allocate resources, and define team roles.\n2. Test Design: Understand and write test cases.\n3. Test Environment Setup: Set up the product in the testing environment.\n4. Test Execution: Run the product and check the test cases.\n5. Defect Report: Document the defect information for developers.\n6. Test Closure: End or terminate the testing phase after checking the actions.\n\nTesting plays an important role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to ensure there are no defects, bugs and the software is reliable and meets the user expectations. The testing helps to gain confidence and customer trust, ensuring that the software product meets the client's specifications and has high quality, leading to customer satisfaction. Testing covers functional requirements and non-functional requirements like maintainability, scalability, efficiency, reusability, reliability, acceptability, understandability, and operability, which will satisfy the customer if it is properly executed.",
      "marks": 7,
      "remark": "The student has provided a comprehensive list of primary objectives and clearly articulated how testing contributes to software reliability by finding defects and ensuring functional/non-functional requirements are met. The link to customer satisfaction through confidence, trust, and meeting specifications is well-explained."

      "question": "Explain the concept of testing a function in context. Compare incremental, top-down, bottom-up, sandwich, and big-bang integration approaches. [BL: Understand| CO: 2|Marks: 7]",
      "text": "Testing function in context\nThe concept of Testing a function in context refers to testing specific modules of a System, which is similar to Unit Testing. Where a particular functionality/feature of a module is tested from a System. Example: In an E-commerce application, testing a specific Payment module.\n\nIncremental Integration\nIncremental integration is an integration approach where modules are integrated partially one after the other and also tested parallelly. It's a simple approach mostly used by Agile teams. Example: Integrate a module and test its interaction with other modules.\n\nTop-down Integration\nTop-down integration is an integration approach where the highest-level modules are first integrated and then the modules downward are added with other modules based on their level of hierarchy in the architecture. In top-down integration testing, stubs are used in the place of dummy values for top-level modules. The top-level modules are tested first and lower (bottom) level modules are tested later.\n\nBottom-up Integration\nBottom-up integration is an integration approach where the lower-level modules are tested first after integration, and then move upwards to higher-level modules based on their level hierarchy in the architecture. In bottom-up integration testing, drivers are used in the place of dummy values as the place holder. In Bottom-up approach, lower-level modules are taken first and higher (Top) level modules are tested later.\n\nSandwich Approach\nSandwich integration is an integration approach where both top-level and bottom-level modules are integrated simultaneously layer by layer. It is a combination of both top-down integration approach and bottom-up integration approach. Where in the affected integrating modules, both stubs and drivers are used as place holders for the place of other modules.\n\nBig-Bang Integration\nThe Big-Bang integration is a complex integration approach where all the modules are integrated at once, making it chaotic and more complex. All modules are integrated and tested at once.",
      "marks": 7,
      "remark": "The explanation of 'testing a function in context' is clear and accurate. The comparison of all five integration approaches (incremental, top-down, bottom-up, sandwich, big-bang) is excellent, correctly detailing each method, including the use of stubs and drivers where appropriate."

      "question": "Summarize how do boundary value analysis (BVA) and decision tables improve test coverage in system testing? Discuss the factors that influence software reliability. [BL: Understand| CO: 2|Marks: 7]",
      "text": "Boundary value analysis (BVA) and decision table\nThe Boundary value and decision table are methods used in Black Box Testing which helps to improve the Test Coverage in System Testing.\n\nBoundary Value Analysis (BVA)\nBVA is a Black Box testing technique that helps to identify boundary cases, i.e., edge cases in software testing. The edge cases play an important role to cover the maximum testing range. There are mainly three types of boundary values:\n1. Minimum Boundary: When for the test cases, the minimum value is calculated.\n2. Maximum Boundary: Where the maximum input that the software can take is calculated.\n3. Invalid/Negative Values: These are values like zero or empty inputs. It helps to identify specific cases.\nExample: For checking the age eligibility for a loan.\nConditions: Age >= 18 (Eligibility criteria)\n[Table structure for age conditions: Conditions (Age) | 0 (F,F) | 10 (F,F) | 18 (T,T) | 100 (T,T).]\n\nDecision Table\nThis is a structured testing approach which is a part of Black Box testing. The data is tabulated. It helps to check the multiple rule chains present in the application system. Example: Aadhar card verification, PAN card detection, etc.\n\nFactors that influence Software Reliability:\n1. Code Quality: Complex code makes it hard to keep track of every bug.\n2. Experience: Experienced team such as experienced testers and senior experienced people are needed.\n3. Defect Resolution Efficiency (DRE): The software should be more reliable.\n4. Code (LOC): Lines of Code. More the code, higher the error probability.\n5. Quality Assurance Metrics: Measures like Mean Time Between Faults (MTBF), Mean Time to Repair (MTTR), Defect Removal Efficiency (DRE), etc. affect the software reliability.\n6. Team Coordination: Team should be properly managed, each department should depend on each other and should cooperate with each other for building reliable software.",
      "marks": 7,
      "remark": "The student accurately explains BVA and Decision Tables, and implicitly how they improve test coverage by targeting critical inputs and complex logic. The example for BVA is relevant. The discussion of factors influencing software reliability is comprehensive and correct, including code quality, experience, DRE, LOC, QA metrics, and team coordination."

      "question": "Mention the factors that influence system test design. How can test case design effectiveness to be measured using metrics? [BL: Understand| CO: 3|Marks: 7]",
      "text": "Factors that influence System Test Design:\n(a) Proper Documentation and Understanding: Required developers and testers should have a proper understanding of the requirements and client consideration.\n(b) Lack of Coordination: Without coordination and proper tracking of the design in test, it could fail.\n(c) Communication: The different teams should be able to communicate effectively with other teams to make the task effective and complete the system design test.\n(d) Hardware Design Compatibility: The hardware should be compatible with the software that is provided. And the software and hardware should work properly.\n(e) Planning: The phase should be planned, scope defined, strategies, resources and goal objectives are needed. And accountability should be verified.\n(f) Feedback and Acceptance: Continuous user or client feedback and acceptance are essential for the success of System Design in Test.\n(g) Hardware Software Integration: In software testing, the hardware and software are tested at once and need to be properly integrated and should work as expected.\nAnd other factors like eligibility, security, maintainability, sales, stress, functionality, stability, GUI, etc. will impact the system design test.\n\nMetrics for Measuring test case design effectiveness:\n1. Total Test cases: Total number of test cases designed.\n2. Test cases Passed: Total number of test cases that passed the test.\n3. Test cases Failed: Total number of test cases that failed the test.\n4. Test cases Omitted: Total number of test cases that crashed the system.\n5. Untested Designs: How many designs are not tested in a unit.\n6. Fault Tolerance: How many bugs can be managed in the software.\nAnd,\n- Mean Time To Detect (MTTD)\n- Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)\n- Defect removal efficiency (DRE)\ncan be used for improving the effectiveness of test case design.",
      "marks": 6,
      "remark": "The student identified several relevant factors influencing system test design. For metrics, 'Total Test cases designed' and 'Test cases Passed/Failed' are more about quantity or execution results than direct design effectiveness. 'Untested Designs' is a good metric. MTTD, MTTR, and DRE are strong metrics for overall quality and defect management, but their direct link to *test case design effectiveness* could be more explicitly stated (e.g., good design leads to better MTTR). 'Fault Tolerance' is a system attribute, not a design effectiveness metric."

      "question": "Elucidate how can finite state machine (FSM) models be used to generate test cases? Discuss the transition tour method with an example. [BL: Understand| CO: 3|Marks: 7]",
      "text": "Finite State Machine (FSM)\nFinite State Machine is a mathematical representation of a software system, which can be used for generating test cases. FSMs have internal components like states, events, inputs, and transitions. The software system is always in one of the defined states. Based on the event and input, the state is changed. The change of state based on the event or input is known as Transition. Using these transitions we can generate the test cases for the software.\n\nExample:\n[Diagram showing states: Login Page, Home Page, Error Message, Reset. Transitions: Login success (to Home Page), Login Fail (to Error Message), Reset (to Login Page), Error message (to Login Page).]\nLet's assume:\nStates: Login, Error, Home, Success, Failure, Reset.\nTransitions: Login Fail -> Error, Error message -> Login, Login Success -> Home.\nUser can enter invalid data and receive an error.\n\nTransition Tour Method:\nThe transition tour method is a technique for Finite State Machine, where the software is been in each state at least once. This technique ensures coverage of states, helping to detect errors or bugs early. It's a simple testing approach covering all available states of the software.\n\n[Diagram showing states: Start, Build, Commit, Verify, Deploy, Failure, Rollback, Stay, Depth, Output. Transitions depicting a software development workflow with possible error and rollback states.]\nIt ensures that the system has been to each state at least once. It covers all existing states.",
      "marks": 7,
      "remark": "The student provides a good explanation of FSM models for test case generation, correctly identifying states, events, and transitions. The login page example helps illustrate the concept. The transition tour method is accurately defined as covering each state at least once, and the workflow diagram, though abstract, supports the explanation of state coverage."

      "question": "Describe McCall’s quality factors. How do these factors relate to specific quality criteria? [BL: Understand| CO: 5|Marks: 7]",
      "text": "McCall’s Quality Factors\nIn the early 1970s, McCall proposed factors that can be used to maintain the software quality. These are based on three perspectives and these quality factors have 11 factors.\n\n1. Product Operations: This perspective focuses on the operability of the product, like its functionality, reliability, and how close it is to the client's requirements. It has 5 factors:\n    1. Functionality: Refers to correctness of output.\n    2. Reliability: Refers to consistency of operations.\n    3. Efficiency: Refers to resource usage and response time.\n    4. Usability: Refers to ease of use and understandability.\n    5. Integrity: Refers to security and access control.\n\n2. Product Revision: The product revision factors describe how easily the product can be modified and maintained. It has 3 factors:\n    1. Maintainability: Easy to change.\n    2. Flexibility: Flexible changes.\n    3. Testability: Able to be tested easily.\n\n3. Product Transition: Product transition refers to the portability and reusability of the product. It has 3 factors:\n    1. Portability: Able to move between different environments.\n    2. Reusability: Easy to adapt.\n    3. Interoperability: Can work with other devices and other systems, and can be easily integrated and tested.",
      "marks": 6,
      "remark": "The student correctly identifies McCall's three quality perspectives and the 11 underlying factors. The definitions for Product Revision and Product Transition factors are accurate. However, for Product Operations, the definitions for 'Functionality' and 'Efficiency' are slightly mixed up with other concepts (Functionality should be correctness/completeness, Efficiency is resource utilization). Otherwise, the answer is well-structured and mostly correct."

      "text": "Software Quality Assurance (SQA)\nSoftware Quality Assurance is not just about testing. It is responsible for the overall product and how good it is to the client's vision. Quality Assurance functions differently in Agile and DevOps environments. It is used in a 'Quality by Design' approach. It is adapted from manufacturing. SQA is responsible for making the developed product more efficient, reliable, and meeting the client's requirements. In the Agile development model, methodologies are used to release updates, leading to continuous deployments. Software Quality Assurance teams are deployed to make sure that the released products meet the requirements of the client. In Agile development, each iteration has its own requirements and verification.\nAnd without SQA in DevOps, test automation, tracking, and CI/CD pipelines will not work effectively. SQA ensures quality using tools like Selenium, JUnit, LoadRunner, JMeter, PractiTest, TestRail, GitHub, etc. It ensures quality in continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment using GitHub actions and automated build and automated testing. So, SQA works as a function in the DevOps environment.",

      "text": "i) Software Fault Tolerance\nSoftware fault tolerance can be explained as the ability of software to work even if faults occur or bugs exist within the system. There are methods used to improve fault tolerance: using duplicate or redundant modules that perform the same task but with different software. Thus, if one fails, the other can take over.\nAnother method is N-versioning software: Software can be developed separately and the output is taken based on the software. Main generated output is taken from a separate output (implying voting or comparison of results).\n\nii) Software Safety Assurance\nSoftware safety assurance includes techniques like security, reliability, strong environment, and scalability. These factors make software robust and reliable. And also prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.\n\niii) Failure Containment\nFailure containment is the process of preventing or containing the failure or bugs in a software system, which helps the reliability by preventing failures or bugs from spreading to other modules. The techniques for failure containment are: Error Isolation and Error Threshold. These are used to perform failure containment.",

      "text": "Root Cause Analysis (RCA)\nRoot Cause Analysis is a systematic approach that helps to identify the root cause or origin of the errors found in software testing. It helps in good decision making. We often find errors using a top-down approach. Let's use reverse engineering from higher-level modules to lower-level modules that are affected by the error. And check each module for minimum (unit) testing and integration testing.\n\n[Diagram depicting a layered application architecture for RCA: Top Level -> Handlers -> Error Mapper -> Input Box -> Services -> API -> Database <- Log In Page <- Low Level]\n\nAfter the error is detected, the defect is prevented from entering production.\n\nExample:\nUsing FTA (Fault Tree Analysis)\nProblem: Light off in a Room\n[Fault Tree Diagram: \nProblem: Light Off in a Room (Top Event)\n  -> OR Gate\n    -> Bulb Failed\n      -> OR Gate\n        -> Bulb Rated (Burned out)\n        -> Fuse Blown\n    -> No Current/No Power on Sockets\n      -> OR Gate\n        -> Switch Not Working/Off\n        -> Plug Box Damaged]\nThis is a good Fault Tree Analysis example to illustrate RCA.",

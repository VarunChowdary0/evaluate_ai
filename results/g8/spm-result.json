      "question": "Mention the main characteristics of conventional software performance. Demonstrate in detail about the evolution of software economics. [BL: Understand| CO: 1|Marks: 7]",
      "text": "Conventional Software Management\nThe conventional project management refers to primitive and traditional techniques and methodologies, which are rigid and have fixed properties. For example, the Waterfall Model.\n\nCharacteristics of Conventional Software (Project) Performance:\n*   **Low Success Rate:** Traditional software project management has a low success rate.\n*   **Rigid Phases:** In traditional software project management, projects have a rigid structure, so they are not flexible to any changes in the requirements.\n*   **Linear and Ordered:** In traditional or conventional software projects, the phases are linear. One phase must be completed before moving to the next phase.\n*   **Defect Propagation:** If defects propagate from one phase to the next phase, it leads to high bug-fixing costs. In conventional projects, if an error is done in the design phase, the bug fixing cost will be more than 100 times in reactional projects.\n*   **No Customer/Stakeholder Feedback or Influence:** There is no customer/stakeholder who can set requirements or provide feedback on their product during exploitation or production.\n\nTo conclude, the main characteristics of conventional software performance include: rigid phases, linear phases, defect propagation, high bug fixing cost, no customer/stakeholder feedback, and also less quality, less reliability, leading to project failure.\n\nEvolution of Software Economics:\nThe economics in the context of software project management involves budget estimation, cost analysis, risk analysis, and other factors like resource planning and project scheduling. Software economics plays an important role in project management. It provides a positive structure about time (duration), resources, personnel, and money needed to complete a project.\n\nThe evolution of software economics includes the software economic evolution through different methodologies like iterative, incremental, and modern process (management).\n*   **From Craftsmanship to Manufacturing:** In the past, developers used to directly jump into coding. But in modern project management, it's about repetitive and predictive approaches. For example, developed packages like reusable code make work efficient and save resources.\n*   It developed from 'Plan-and-Stick-to-it' to iterative and incremental approaches.",

      "question": "Explain briefly about the pragmatic cost estimation. How does pragmatic cost estimation differ from theoretical models? [BL: Understand| CO: 1|Marks: 7]",
      "text": "Pragmatic Cost Estimation:\nPragmatic cost estimation is estimating the budget in a real-world and practical way, using accumulated knowledge like historic data from the organization and experiences. It is not based on theoretical models. Pragmatic cost estimation estimates the budget based on experience and intuition, and not on current market values, which will give more accurate results compared to cost estimation using theoretical methods like COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model) or function points.\nIt is a practical cost estimation method based on intuition, experience, and historic data. This makes it accurate and effective. Modern project cost estimation should allow for mixing pragmatic and analytical data for estimation.\n\nDifference between Pragmatic Cost Estimation and Theoretical Models:\n| Pragmatic Cost Estimation | Theoretical Models |\n| :--------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |\n| Uses practical knowledge for cost estimation | Uses theoretical models for cost estimation |\n| Real-world and practical way to estimate budget | Theoretical and process-driven to estimate budget |\n| Stable for organizations with historic data | Best for small or starting organizations |\n| Based on experience and intuition | Needs all required data and a theoretical model |\n| Accurate for real projects | Not accurate for complex projects |",

      "text": "Modern Software Management:\nModern software management applies the latest and modern tools and methodologies to implement projects. This includes proper planning, scheduling, scope identification, process management, and budget estimation using the latest tools and methods.\n\nCore Principles of Modern Software Management:\n*   **Team Management:** The teams should be hierarchical with proper accountability and stability.\n*   **Improved Size:** The project size should be minimized without any future risks.\n*   **Personnel Development:** Teams should be self-balanced, helping each other with knowledge.\n*   **Environment:** The project should use modern tools and automation to improve efficiency.\n*   **Planning:** Every phase should be properly planned before implementation.\n*   **Required Quality:** The project should achieve its required quality, both functional and non-functional requirements.\n\nPeer Inspections and their Roles in Quality Assurance:\nPeer inspection plays an important role in maintaining project quality. Peer inspection refers to the review or inspection done in a project. Here are the steps involved in peer inspection:\n1.  **Planning:** Plan the inspection (e.g., fixing scope and schedule).\n2.  **Overview Meeting:** Conduct an overview meeting with the team and explain the phase.\n3.  **Preparation:** Prepare by reading the code, identifying questions, etc.\n4.  **Inspection Meeting:** Go through the project and identify defects or mistakes that could affect software quality.\n5.  **Rework/Reporting:** Make sure reports are generated, changes are made, bugs are fixed, and follow-up with all stakeholders.",

      "question": "Enlist five strategies to improve software economics. How can team effectiveness be improved in a software project? [BL: Understand| CO: 2|Marks: 7]",
      "text": "Software Economics:\nSoftware economics refers to the study and analysis of software impact such as budget, cost analysis, risk analysis, resource management, and planning objectives. Economics plays an important role in software development life cycle (SDLC).\n\nFive Strategies to Improve Software Economics:\n1.  **Improving Scope:** In software, 'more' is not equal to 'better'. More code leads to more complexity and is hard to debug and adapt to changes. So, the code must be robust, reusable, modularized, and readable for a good quality product.\n2.  **Improved Team Management:** Team management plays a crucial role in improving software economics. The team should be properly organized in a hierarchical manner. This will improve accountability and coordination.\n3.  **Automating Tasks:** Automating tasks like building applications, testing, and deployment should be done (e.g., Selenium test automation, Jira, Bugzilla, GitHub Actions, CI/CD automation). This will improve efficiency, reduce manual work, and make it efficient by giving more time to the developers.\n4.  **Improving Process:** The process refers to the steps for doing a task. This improves the outcomes. There are three types of software processes: Meta Process, Macro Process, Micro Process.\n5.  **Peer Inspection:** It is an inspection method to improve the quality of the product, which includes the following steps: Planning, Overview, Preparation, Inspection, Rework/Reporting.\n\nHow Team Effectiveness can be Improved in a Software Project:\nAn effective team is important to improve software economics as it contributes to software quality. The team members should prioritize communication and coordination with each other. And also, conduct regular public/project meetings and keep updated with the project progress.",

      "question": "Summarize about inception, elaboration, construction, and transition phases with examples. [BL: Understand| CO: 3|Marks: 7]",
      "text": "Life Cycle Phases:\nThe life cycle phases explain each activity and things done in a software development life cycle.\n\n1.  **Inception Phase:** The inception phase is the initial and an important phase in the software development life cycle. In this phase, analyzing the project and high-level requirements is done (e.g., creating a business case, identifying stakeholders, etc.).\n2.  **Elaboration Phase:** The elaboration phase is the second phase in the software development life cycle. In this phase, project planning and architectural requirements are defined. This involves requirement analysis, risk analysis, etc. The project is elaborated for all stakeholders. Architectural baselines and integration plans are also defined here. Excessive costs, project requirements, and team planning are reduced in this phase.\n3.  **Construction Phase:** The construction phase is the main development phase in the software development life cycle. This construction phase includes building components, unit testing, and integration. Then, testing is done to produce the final product. Example: building a house includes individual rooms, bathrooms, and integration into a final product.\n4.  **Transition Phase:** Transition phase is the final phase in the software development life cycle. Here, the developed product will be released and training is provided for the real product. Here, system testing, unit testing, and acceptance testing are done to ensure the product is built correctly. The product is then given to the customer. This is the last phase for product delivery.\n*   **Diagram (interpreted from \"4b) lekw...\"):**\n    *   Water Flow Model (Diagram showing linear phases)\n        *   Requirement Gathering\n        *   Inception Phase\n        *   Construction Phase\n        *   Implementation\n        *   Testing\n        *   Elaboration Phase\n        *   Transition Phase\n        *   Maintenance\n        *   Production and Retirement Phase",

      "question": "List kinds of behavioral and object model. Analyze the role of model-based architectures from a technical perspective. [BL: Apply| CO: 3|Marks: 7]",
      "text": "Behavioral and Object Models:\nBehavioral and Object Models are widely used in software project management and development. They are built using modeling languages like Unified Modeling Language (UML). They are abstract (high-level diagrams). These models help in the project planning and design phase of software development.\n*   **Behavioral Models** illustrate the interaction between objects.\n*   **Object Models** explain the structure of the model, like a database and module structure.\n\nExamples of Behavioral and Object Models (UML Diagrams):\n*   Activity Diagram\n*   Class Diagram\n*   State Machine Diagram\n*   Object Diagram\n*   Use Case Diagram\n*   Flow Diagram\n*   Architecture Diagrams\n\nRole of Model-Based Architectures from a Technical Perspective:\nThe model-based architecture plays a significant role in the development and management of the project. Models give an overview of the design and planning process. For example, for developing an industrial project, accuracy is important. Models also act as artifacts, which can help the team to communicate and monitor the project progress. During validating requirements and estimating costs, the team implements (uses) programmatic architecture. Architecture helps the team to understand the project (like a blueprint of a project).",

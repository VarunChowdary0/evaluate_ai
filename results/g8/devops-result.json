      "question": "Explain the process of branching and merging in Git. What are the best practices for managing branches and resolving conflicts?",
      "text": "Branching and Merging in Git. Git is an open-source distributed version control platform that provides various services. Git allows us to create multiple branches for the same repository. A repository is a codebase given for a project. There can be many branches for a repository which will be maintained by different teams. Suppose a company wants to add a product which is in production and the company wants to add multiple independent features for the product. Here, the company will create one new branch for each feature. Each feature is independent. For example, if a bug goes into release 0.1 for new features, here each branch is tested and built. The main (or 'production') repository will have the authority to merge these branches with the production branch. And the authority is responsible for accepting the pull requests for that branch, and only then is it safe to delete the feature branch.\n\n[Diagram: Feature (B1), Feature (B2) -> Production Branch. begin) B3. (various arrows and text like git push, merge conflicts)]\n\nManaging Conflicts: Conflicts sometimes occur when you are merging branches. The best practices for managing conflicts in Git is to ensure the files are properly imported. Add all related modules correctly. To resolve conflicts, you should re-read the code. Only the bug-free branches can be merged with the production branch.",
      "marks": 5,
      "remark": "Good explanation of branching and merging with a clear example. The description of conflict resolution best practices is somewhat generic and lacks specific Git commands or advanced strategies like `git mergetool` or `git rebase`."

      "question": "Your team is struggling with maintaining consistency in infrastructure configurations across multiple environments. How would you implement infrastructure as Code (IaC) to address this challenge?",
      "text": "Struggling with maintaining consistency in infrastructure configurations across multiple environments. Inconsistency in maintaining infrastructure configurations across multiple environments could lead to issues like system crashes, accessibility problems, reliability issues, performance issues, and bad user experience. Implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) will solve this inconsistency challenge. Our issue is to deploy on multiple environments. Infrastructure as Code will help maintain the configurations in infrastructure across multiple environments, which directly resolves problems with varying response times, multiple environment scalability issues, and performance issues. To implement Infrastructure as Code, developers should have good knowledge about how code can be modularized, reusable, and structured. They should follow SOLID principles and implement practices like caching and implicit dependencies. For example, 'refresh on refresh' (this seems like a random example, perhaps meant to illustrate a concept but is poorly explained). This is a common method for many products to make the user feel like the data is loaded instantaneously. But in reality, all data will load in parts, which is pre-loaded when the application is opened, and the data is refreshed and stored when the user opens the particular page. This gives the illusion that the data is loaded instantaneously. This problem of inconsistency in infrastructure configuration across multiple environments could be solved using the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) technique.",
      "marks": 4,
      "remark": "Correctly identifies the problem and proposes IaC as the solution, listing relevant benefits and general principles for developers. However, the lengthy 'refresh on refresh' example is completely irrelevant to IaC and infrastructure consistency, distracting from the core answer. It also doesn't mention specific IaC tools (e.g., Terraform, Ansible, Chef, Puppet) which would strengthen the implementation aspect."

      "question": "Discuss the key architectural differences between SVN and Git. How do these differences impact the way teams use these tools for version control and collaboration?",
      "text": "Subversion (SVN) and Git. Key architectural differences: Subversion (SVN) System is a file-based system. It stores each version as a whole file. Limited offline control. Lacks abilities like conflict resolution and rollbacks. Git is an open-source Version Control Software. Each version can be stored in a new branch. Unlimited offline control. Has special abilities like conflict resolution and instant rollbacks.\n\nImpact on Teams: Using Subversion (SVN) or Git will greatly impact the teams, as these tools provide version control and collaboration.\na) While using SVN: SVN is a primitive, file-based version control system. Users might face access or deadlock issues while trying to access particular files. SVN is a centralized system, which could be vulnerable to attacks. All intellectual property or data could be corrupted or leaked.\nb) While using Git: Git is a distributed system, so no one has authority to grant or revoke access. The particular person in the team using Git is highly secure and needs proper authentication.\nc) Considering the collaboration between team members, using Git will help teams and simplifies the complex process of sharing and code reviews.",
      "marks": 3,
      "remark": "The comparison of architectural differences contains several inaccuracies: SVN stores deltas, not whole files, and it does support conflict resolution and rollbacks (though Git's are more advanced). Stating that in Git 'each version can be stored in a new branch' is incorrect; versions are commits. The statement that 'no one has authority to grant or revoke access' in Git is also misleading; access control is managed at the repository hosting level (e.g., GitHub, GitLab). While the answer correctly highlights the centralized vs. distributed nature and Git's benefits for collaboration, the technical details of the architectural differences are largely flawed."

      "question": "A critical bug was introduced in the latest commit on the main branch. How would you use Git to identify the commit that introduced the bug and revert the changes?",
      "text": "Bug hunting and requesting change. Considering the case that a critical bug was introduced in the main branch in the latest commit. (Assuming main branch is the production branch). The first step is to identify the bug in the production and roll back to the previous commit. It is certain that the bug was included in the latest commit. Git simplifies the task, like activities such as modifying, or reverting. Git reverses the changes back to previous commits. After checking, Git continuously serves the previous versions and acts as the best model that can automatically make bug-free versions. We also need to run the tests to ensure the bug has been resolved and everything is as expected.\n\nNext step is damage control. These could cause huge monetary damage through the system. We need to roll back the changes made in the database if the bug and its consequences are fully certain. If we have created an issue, it will push to the main branch.\n\nGit makes it very easy to track changes in each commit. Git maintains a record of each commit, so that person has made changes. Git makes it easy to revert the changes.",
      "marks": 3,
      "remark": "The answer correctly identifies the need to find the bug and revert, but lacks specific Git commands or strategies for identification (e.g., `git bisect`, `git blame`) and reversion (e.g., `git revert`, `git reset` with an explanation of their differences). The claim that 'Git continuously serves the previous versions and acts as the best model that can automatically make bug-free versions' is a significant misconception; Git provides tools, but the process is manual and requires human intervention for verification and fixing. The operational considerations like database rollback are good but not directly Git-related."

      "text": "Key components and architecture of Docker. We can consider Docker as a tool that simplifies portability issues. While developing a project, we use many packages and finally build the final code. The code needs to run on various devices and different operating systems. It is difficult to configure the project for each device. Here Docker comes in. Using Docker, we can create a Docker container which has an entire OS (operating system). This can be easily deployed on different devices without any additional configuration.\n\nDocker Engine: Docker Engine is a software application that can be downloaded into our system, which provides CLI commands (command-line interface) to access Docker on your computer.\n\nDocker Hub: Docker Hub is a web-based platform that publishes Docker repositories which contain containers and images.\n\nDocker Containers: A box which can have a Docker image stored inside. They are used to run/manage Docker images.\n\nDocker Images: Docker images are binary packages related to Docker. They make up the whole project enclosed in it.\n\nNetwork and Volume: The terms 'network' and 'volume' used in Docker are actually images called Volume, which is for local or Docker Hub.",
      "marks": 4,
      "remark": "Good explanations for Docker Engine, Docker Hub, Docker Containers, and Docker Images, though describing a container as having 'an entire OS' is an oversimplification; it shares the host kernel. The explanation for 'Network and Volume' is fundamentally incorrect; these are distinct components for container communication and persistent data storage, not 'images called Volume'."

      "question": "Your team is migrating an existing monolithic application to microservices architecture using docker containers. Outline the steps and considerations for breaking down the monolith into smaller, independently deployable containers.",
      "text": "Migrating from monolithic application architecture to Microservice architecture.\nMonolithic application is an application that has only a single block interacting with the backend and a database. It will have backend services (APIs) accessible directly, performing calculations and operating the database.\nMicroservice architecture: In Microservice architecture, there are many service blocks, and each service block will perform only a simple task.\nSo, to migrate a monolithic application into a Microservice architecture application using Docker containers, the following steps can be taken:\n1) Writing microservices\n2) Database migration (or 'migration on its own' - unclear)\n3) Testing microservices\n4) Converting microservices to Docker containers (Sos - 'Source Code' - unclear)\n5) Managing Docker containers, running the created images.\n6) Deploying.\n\n[Diagram]\nMonolithic Application: (Layer) -> (Database)\nMicroservices: Microservice1 -> Image1, Microservice2 -> Image2, Microservice3 -> Image3 -> Docker Container",

The outlined migration steps are logical and cover essential phases, including writing services, database considerations, testing, containerization, management, and deployment. The diagram, while simple, effectively illustrates the conceptual shift. The 'Sos' and 'migration on its own' parts are a little unclear, but do not significantly detract from the overall quality."

      "question": "Compare EC2 reserved instances, on-demand instances and spot instances in terms of pricing models, cost optimization strategies and use cases for each type.",
      "text": "Amazon Elastic Compute (EC2) is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS), which provides a virtual machine on the cloud. The AWS EC2 service offers: Reserved instances, On-Demand instances, Spot instances. It is important to know which is the most stable instance model based on the use case.\n1. Reserved Instances: These are scalable and offer a low price compared to others. Good for expected usage.\n2. On-Demand Instances: These are scalable based on the traffic, and prices are bound to specific packages.\n3. Spot Instances: These are pre-tested with top performance. They are efficient for applications with continuous traffic.",
      "marks": 3,
      "remark": "The answer correctly identifies the three instance types. However, the comparison is superficial and contains inaccuracies. Reserved Instances are for committed capacity and cost savings, not primarily 'scalable'. On-Demand Instances are priced per hour/second, not 'bound to specific packages'. The description of Spot Instances ('pre-tested with top performance', 'efficient for applications with continuous traffic') is incorrect; they are for fault-tolerant workloads that can handle interruptions, leveraging unused AWS capacity at a lower cost, not for uninterrupted continuous traffic."

      "marks": 4,
      "remark": "Several correct advantages are listed, such as portability, easy packaging, and dependency management. The point about 'easy access' is vague, and 'simplify' is incomplete. A significant inaccuracy is the claim that Docker containers 'support many operating systems'; containers share the host's kernel and are thus tied to the host OS architecture (e.g., Linux containers run on a Linux kernel). While Docker *itself* runs on various OS, the containers do not run natively across different kernels without a VM layer."

However, it misses many crucial elements of a comprehensive test plan (e.g., scope, objectives, entry/exit criteria, test environment, test data management, schedule, responsibilities, risk assessment, reporting). The example test matrix and cases provided are poorly structured, unclear, and contain errors, indicating a lack of practical understanding in designing effective test scenarios."

      "remark": "The answer correctly emphasizes the inclusion of edge cases, potential failure points, and the importance of understanding requirements. It also appropriately mentions different levels of testing (Unit, Integration, Acceptance/Functional). The mention of 'top-down and bottom-up approaches' is relevant, although not elaborated. Similar to 7.a, it focuses more on test design principles rather than the complete structure and content of a 'comprehensive test plan' document, which typically includes scope, objectives, resources, schedule, etc."

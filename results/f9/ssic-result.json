      "question": "Write about hard skills and soft skills and mention the significance of soft skills for the engineering students.",
      "text": "Hard skills are acquired through technical knowledge to solve problems. Hard skills are abilities to solve complex problems related to your subject domain. These skills are essential because they help build careers and move forward in a professional environment. Hard skills are skills that can be used to find a solution. Hard skills are bookish, also called technical skills because we acquire this technical knowledge. These skills include solving math problems, coding, etc. Therefore, hard skills are required to put effort and use them to advance your career.\n\nSoft skills are skills that deal with the non-technical aspects of your skills. These include skills like leadership, adaptability, teamwork, command, focus. These skills are important to develop ourselves and are the most important variety of soft skills to build relationships, de-escalate conflicts and effective communication. These skills help build characters and values. These are the skills where a person is judged based on their etiquette.\n\nEven though hard skills are important to students, soft skills play a crucial role. For example, if you are intelligent, but not enough in hard skills, engineering students won't succeed. They only rely on hard skills. Hard skills take time to develop. A student gets disturbed by normal classroom studies and internal examinations. Soft skills are learned over time.\n\nAfter technical rounds, students must face HR interviews. Without soft skills, they fail to get a job. In several universities, they are interested in the professional and soft skills to build a relationship between firms so that the student can be essential and confident in class to stick with a company that might have a connection with overseas companies. Soft skills also help to improve teamwork and problem-solving skills by working in a team. This is the significance of soft skills for engineering students.",

      "remark": "The answer provides a good definition of both hard and soft skills. It clearly outlines the significance of soft skills for engineering students, covering aspects like job interviews, professional relationships, global connections, and teamwork. The explanation is comprehensive and relevant to the prompt."

      "question": "“We never get a second chance to make the first impression.” Do you agree or disagree? Why? Support this statement with an example.",
      "text": "I agree with this statement because first impressions are lasting impressions. The first impression is how a person deals with the other person when they meet for the first time. Our initial reaction shows the person about us. Based on the first impression, the entire conversation continues. First impressions are important aspects of soft skills because they enhance job opportunities and build your personality. When we first meet, we find out about the character of the other person. This is because due to the limited amount of information that the other person has, the impression occurs over the whole exterior choice of the person. Though it is unmasked and untrue, you need to be careful about managing your next meeting to show yourself to the other person.\n\nFor example, if you are attending an interview and entered with an unenthusiastic face, straight face without smiling, the interviewer immediately assumes you are dull and uninterested. Even if you answer all questions in the interview and show them good technical knowledge, the interviewer may feel bad about your candidature because of the initial first impression. Similarly, take another scenario where you enter the interview with a bright smile and cheerful attitude. The interviewer sets a good tone for the entire interview and is more inclined to pick you for the job, despite a similar performance. This is because due to a good initial impression, the interviewer shows more interest in you and even wants to know what you have offered in the statement. Therefore, we need to be careful about the impression. In short, one's soft skills help build robust relationships. Even for those who get a second chance, they lead to good results and ensure one needs not to make a second impression.",
      "marks": 7,
      "remark": "The student clearly states agreement and provides a strong justification for the importance of first impressions, linking it to lasting perceptions, job opportunities, and personality building. The two contrasting examples in an interview setting effectively illustrate the statement. One minor contradictory sentence about managing future meetings is present, but the overall argument and examples strongly support the agreement."

      "question": "Describe with examples the self-fulfillment and happiness of productive interpersonal communication skills. When will we able to tell if it worked?",
      "text": "Productive Interpersonal Communication skills are skills that help us control and improve ourselves. These are skills that deal with how to change ourselves for the better through various techniques and efforts. These skills are essential for one because they help a person to develop and also improve already existing skills. Self-fulfillment and happiness are attributed to productive interpersonal communication skills. These skills are the skills that teach us to achieve and make plans to develop ourselves for all skills and beyond the existing ones. To use for a better version of ourselves. These are the skills that involve maintaining individuality. When we do this, we find that we save time and money with those tactics. When we dedicate ourselves to that, we complete the tasks in a short amount of time.\n\nWe should also master enough to conquer our moves to result in productive outcomes. We should also communicate with ourselves because sometimes there is a mismatch between what we want to do and what we do. We need to communicate within ourselves. We should apply productive skills. For example, in communication skills: we achieve deadlines without much pressure when we dedicate ourselves. The same self-fulfillment happens, a sense of achievement where we put our best work and we achieve a sense of self-fulfillment. If our desires, unless they are realized, we are not satisfied. We need to put effort. For success, if we have a sense of accomplishment. Thus, self-fulfillment has a vital role in our needs, happiness. On the other hand, happiness deals with emotional and external skills. Happiness is a state of emotion where we feel intense satisfaction with what we achieve. Happiness plays a key role in these skills.\n\nFor example, we have to understand two parts: to plan and to stick to it. If we are focused and disciplined without postponing and finish our tasks and submit them at the due time, we achieve a sense of accomplishment and with the happiness that we completed our work on time. With the self-fulfillment, our confidence will increase. We also realize when we experience those positive emotions.",
      "marks": 5,
      "remark": "The student defines self-fulfillment and happiness clearly. However, the definition and examples provided lean heavily towards self-management, personal productivity, and internal communication rather than *interpersonal communication* skills specifically. The examples given (achieving deadlines, planning, task completion) are results of good personal work ethic, which may involve IPC but don't exemplify it directly. The 'when it worked' part is addressed by mentioning positive emotions and a sense of accomplishment."

      "question": "Prepare a conversation between you and the principal of your college asking him permission to participate in sports at a state level competition and also you may not be able to attend the classes for one week. For that reason, you have to convince him to provide attendance for one week.",
      "text": "Student: Good Morning Sir. I am a third-year B.E. student and I am here to ask you permission about a state-level competition.\nPrincipal: Good Morning. What is the competition about and what do you want from me?\nStudent: I am participating in a technical event and I've been selected for a state-level competition and I am here to request your permission to participate in it.\nPrincipal: Congratulations for your selection.\nStudent: Thank you Sir. I request you to provide me attendance for one week so that I could attend the competition.\nPrincipal: When is your competition and how long does it take?\nStudent: The competition is held from [Date] to [Date] for one week. Please provide me attendance for that one week.\nPrincipal: But don't you have exams coming up? And would you be focusing on that competition rather than your studies?\nStudent: Yes Sir, internal exams are scheduled for next month and I will have enough time to prepare for them.\nPrincipal: Okay, but won't you miss out on a few classes? How will you manage to maintain good grades?\nStudent: I promise I will take notes and study, I won't need to ask you.\nPrincipal: Okay, now I am convinced. Do your best to balance your studies and sports. Permission granted. Don't forget to bring that medal. All the Best!\nStudent: Thank you very much Sir. I am grateful to you and yes, I will bring that medal and I will keep my word. Thank you Again. End of Conversation.",
      "marks": 4,
      "remark": "The conversation format is well-executed with logical flow and appropriate dialogue for both roles. The student effectively addresses the principal's concerns about studies and attendance. However, a significant deduction is made because the student repeatedly states 'technical event' instead of 'sports' competition, which is a core detail explicitly mentioned in the question prompt. This indicates a misreading of the question scenario."

      "question": "Interpret the importance of learning speech sounds of english language for fluent and confident communication. Why is the lack of the aforementioned a problem?",
      "text": "Learning speech sounds of English language is of utmost importance for any English speaker because it allows for fluent and confident communication. Speech sounds of English language are the sounds that are produced when the speaker talks and communicates. These sounds are the pronunciation of the words. When speakers speak, words are spoken in a manner and with punctuation. It is important to understand them. Therefore, the listener can know the more important things. So, these are the determinant of speech sounds. Speech sounds are mostly called \"vocalization\" of the language because they allow us to convey the content and say what we want to be understood. In English language, all the letters are not always pronounced and some contain words which are silent. The pronunciation depends on the formation and placement between the letters.\n\nFor example, in the word \"Psychology\", 'p' is silent and isn't pronounced. For example, in the word 'pacific ocean', the letter 'c' is pronounced differently at each instance. First 'c' makes 's' sound, second 'c' makes 'k' sound and the third 'c' makes 'sh' sound. Therefore, speech sounds are very important for fluent, confident communication to help the listener to understand the speech. We have to observe how our bodies and speech behave as speakers for confident communication.\n\nWithout the knowledge of speech sounds, it may lead to misunderstandings (problems). Without knowledge of speech sounds, one cannot explain what they are saying. This leads to miscommunication and leads to conflicts. To understand the contents of the statement, one needs to be interested in it. This leads to problems and discomfort. It may also lead to the speaker's stress without proper communication skills. These are the problems that occur when the listener states a lack of understanding. So, speech sounds in English language are for fluent and confident communication.",
      "marks": 7,
      "remark": "The answer thoroughly explains the importance of learning speech sounds for fluent and confident communication, emphasizing clarity and understanding. It correctly identifies the problems arising from a lack of this knowledge (miscommunication, conflict, speaker stress). The example of 'Psychology' (silent 'p') is good. However, the 'pacific ocean' example for the letter 'c' is inaccurate in its phonetic breakdown, as 'c' in 'ocean' is part of a digraph 'ce' making a /ʃ/ sound, not 'c' alone. Despite this minor flaw, the overall answer is strong."

      "question": "What is mother tongue influence? Throw light on a few examples from your mother tongue that influences the spoken communication.",
      "text": "Mother tongue influence is the influence of the mother tongue in spoken English. It deals with the speech sounds of English language. When a non-native speaker of English language speaks, they have a certain accent and pronunciation. The pronunciation changes to a completely different meaning. Some people can't differentiate 'r' and 'l' which leads to miscommunication and creates arguments and it will lead to confusions. The mother tongue influences the pronunciation and the speech of non-native speakers because their language they speak interferes with the English communication practices. Therefore, to reduce confusion and improve our communication, for the English speaking, we have to neutralize the mother tongue influence. First, we have to identify what are the shortcomings we experience because of our mother tongue influence. What we didn't identify before and correct them individually before moving into the speech practice. After learning our based on observation and also speech sounds, to observe the conversation between native speakers. We need to ensure that our mother tongue doesn't influence the speech sounds of English language.\n\nThis is about the influence. Mother tongue influence in spoken communication occurs in a few ways. For example, some people can't differentiate between /v/ and /w/ sounds. The words /voice/ and /boys/ sound similar due to their mother tongue. Since they also directly pronounce the word 'iron' where they pronounce it as 'eiron' instead of 'ai-ran' due to MTI. Also, due to mother tongue, where most syllables are stressed, non-native English speakers also stress the last syllable. Here instead of 'doctor' or 'father' I would unknowingly say 'docTOR' or 'faTHER'. Here, MTI can easily be observed. These are some examples from mother tongue shortcomings in spoken communications in English language.",
      "marks": 7,
      "remark": "The student provides a clear and accurate definition of Mother Tongue Influence (MTI). The answer then offers several excellent and common examples of MTI, including the confusion between 'r' and 'l', /v/ and /w/ sounds, the pronunciation of 'iron', and the misplacement of stress on the last syllable of words. The examples are well-chosen and effectively illustrate the concept."

      "question": "What is meant by style? How significant is style in writing? Explain in detail.",
      "text": "Style refers to the way we write. It is the way a person writes. It is the way your text should provide important context about the reader. Also, loosely understood as the format of the script. We follow different styles for different writings in communication. Style is the way the writer should provide important details about the writer and their reason for the communication. Every writer has their own unique style that is distinguished from each other and becomes an identification mark for the writer himself. These are two types of styles: Formal style and Informal style.\n\nFormal style is the style that follows certain rules. The tone of the communication is serious and to the point. Formal style is primarily used in academic institutions, official authorities, etc. among others. It is used to communicate with different types in a formal and direct manner without any deviation.\n\nInformal style is the approach that deals with basic language, tone and relaxed approach. It is the style where the tone isn't serious and we can express our views, feelings, etc. in a casual style. It is primarily used to communicate with friends, family, and siblings, etc.\n\nStyle also plays a key role in writing. As it plays a significant role in determining the content of the writing. Without a style, no important content will be conveyed as the given sentence will not make sense. It leads to a loss of meaning. It leads to miscommunication (poor communication). Therefore, style has a vital role to understand important content and enhance the confidence of the writer. This is the significance of style especially in writing.",
      "marks": 7,
      "remark": "The student defines style adequately as 'the way we write' and as an 'identification mark' for the writer. It correctly differentiates between formal and informal styles, providing accurate descriptions and contexts for each. The significance of style in writing is well-explained, highlighting its role in conveying content, avoiding miscommunication, and enhancing writer confidence, even if the phrasing 'determining the content' is slightly imprecise. Overall, a comprehensive answer."

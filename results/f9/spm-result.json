      "question": "Mention the main characteristics of conventional software performance. Demonstrate in detail about the evolution of software economics. [BL: Understand| CO: 1|Marks: 7]",
      "text": "Conventional methods, also known as traditional methods, followed a step-by-step process. In a project, such methods involved one-time steps, without the opportunity to change them. The project plan and architecture for the project for traditional methods were too rigid and therefore lead to project failures. Conventional methods were suitable for simple and smaller projects. If the architecture promotes reusability, it does not work in a project. Hence, conventional methods were less productive because the development cycle was slow. The goal was to make efficient and more effective software, but at a slow rate. The reduced reusability of the conventional methods is also important because it creates a huge impact on the project, which is a drawback of conventional methods. It is rigid and takes more time to fix the original prototype, leading to reduced reusability of conventional methods. This method's drawback is also the slow start of the development, so we don't know if software development judges the huge needs before we start. This led to budget overruns and less effectiveness. These were the main characteristics of conventional methods.\n\nSoftware economics focuses on the economic aspects of software. In the earliest years, software economics focused on the budget and timelines, which were fixed, leading to budget overruns. The estimation of software was based on Lines of Code (LOC) and the total duration of the project. If it took a long time to implement such rigid methods, it therefore led to an inaccurate software outcome. In the earliest years of software economics, project evaluation was not done for a long time. So the developers often ended up with a more dynamic spread. In these new areas, we focus on value maximization instead of a static model. We focus on the effectiveness of the software and its functional value. It always provides benefits to the user.",
      "marks": 4,
      "remark": "The student correctly identifies rigidity, slow development, project failures, and lack of reusability as characteristics of conventional methods. The discussion on the evolution of software economics touches on early rigid models (LOC, fixed budgets) and a shift towards value maximization and dynamic approaches. However, the explanation is somewhat repetitive and lacks deeper insight into specific economic models or shifts in cost structure (e.g., from development to maintenance, or labor to COTS/tools). It's a foundational understanding but not detailed enough for full marks."

      "question": "Explain briefly about the pragmatic cost estimation. How does pragmatic cost estimation differ from theoretical models? [BL: Understand| CO: 1|Marks: 7]",
      "text": "Pragmatic cost estimation: To the total value, we estimate costs based on practical, realistic, and half-true conditions – taking into account factors like the total outcome of the estimation. Pragmatic cost estimation follows these principles: It is resolved unlike the old traditional approach. Traditional methods are for a static approach, where we continuously estimate the cost of the software (which is dynamic and changes from a static to a dynamic state). The estimation relies on the needs of the software and the market conditions. It also involves the reusability so that any team can use it. The users’ experience should be weighed for the software to make a fast, more accurate, and practical system.\n\nPragmatic approach encourages developers to estimate costs based on project skills rather than a single approach. It also provides the estimate. It avoids calling a single number because it directly makes changes to achieve and allows it to be a more realistic approach, which is a starting point, but we still have an estimate to budget and when the project might slightly exceed. It is the scenario when the budget is most likely to overrun. It also helps when we use historical data along with the experience of the team members to agree to a realistic outcome. Pragmatic cost estimation also uses different models. The pragmatic estimation also checks the algorithms that are used in the project and also checks if it structures the data that stores the cost. It also checks the functional conditions of the project, so it estimates based on functionality rather than lines of code and makes the outcome more satisfactory.\n\nPragmatic cost estimation differs from theoretical models because theoretical models rely on the static world. Entire models will end up looking like the final outcome that is showing to the user than the models that are being implemented. Theoretical models fundamentally rely on the actual world entities and are often disconnected from the actual situation that leads to inaccuracies. It generally doesn’t take into account the team's needs and current capabilities. Pragmatic models rely on the actual world data that is available and used, well-tested with insight from actual experts. It also accounts for unintended outcomes because it helps us to predict how pragmatic cost estimation differs from theoretical models.",
      "marks": 6,
      "remark": "The student provides a good explanation of pragmatic cost estimation, highlighting its focus on practical conditions, continuous adjustment, market needs, team experience, and functionality over LOC. The differentiation from theoretical models is also well-articulated, emphasizing the rigidity and reliance on static data in theoretical models versus the adaptability and real-world insights of pragmatic estimation. The explanation is comprehensive and largely accurate, earning high marks."

      "question": "Outline the core principles of modern software management. Discuss peer inspections and their roles in quality assurance. [BL: Understand| CO: 2|Marks: 7]",
      "text": "The modern software management is based on the iterative approach. Unlike the old management where it is rigid and inflexible, the modern management is very flexible and it is more dramatic. It evolves with the current trends and takes the user needs into account. The modern software management is based on the agile and scrum models, where the emphasis is not on the documentation, but the value maximization. It allows for multiple efforts and individualized support where the team members are collaboratively involved. Unlike traditional management where there is each department working separately, modern management is based on collaboration around the stakeholders. It aims at enhancing the productivity and leading to better outcomes. This collaboration is based on the communication. There is improved communication among different team members, leading to collaboration among different teams.\n\nModern management, unlike traditional ones, is also non-hierarchical in nature, where users are free not to interact directly to the higher-ups and flexible. The user is also not expected to follow a strict top-down policy, where we always move quickly to the starting point of the development. These are the core principles of modern software management.\n\nPeer Inspections: How do peer inspections reduce the defects of our software project? They fully reflect our team's capabilities. Peer inspections are conducted before the end. They can utilize their experience at an early stage. It's often difficult to do a check on our own, and it will help the project's success. They also do a truthful job in improving the quality of a project by identifying and correcting errors early. Such errors can be fixed by peers, so they prevent bias and lead to a more efficient project. This is about how peer inspections play a key role in quality assurance of a software project.",
      "marks": 6,
      "remark": "The student correctly outlines core principles of modern software management, emphasizing iterative, flexible, value-driven, collaborative, communication-focused, and non-hierarchical approaches. The discussion on peer inspections is also good, highlighting their role in early defect detection, quality improvement, team learning, and reducing bias. The answer is comprehensive and accurate for both parts."

      "question": "Elucidate the reason why the elaboration phase is critical for architectural stability? Describe management, and engineering artifacts. [BL: Understand| CO: 4|Marks: 7]",
      "text": "Elaboration phase is the phase for the architectural stability of the software project. It is critical for the architectural stability of any software project because this is where we design the architecture after the inception phase. Here, we identify and capture the required requirements to meet the environment. The elaboration phase is where we relate and elaborate on the problems. In elaboration phase, we elaborate on the problems and elaborate on different components of the architecture that should be built according to the needs. This is the stage where we get an overall idea about the architecture of the project and then we design and divide this architecture into individual components and assign to each component. We plan the components individually so that it can be done together to make the architecture. The architecture is the backbone of any software project, therefore it needs to be stable. If the architecture is not designed properly in the elaboration phase, then it leads to an architectural instability that might lead to a failure of our project. Therefore, elaboration phase is critical for architectural stability.\n\nManagement and engineering artifacts are the tangible aspects of the software project. These are the various different aspects of the software project. Management artifacts relate to the productivity where they can be converted with the metrics like the time and the team's productivity. Also, user needs to be managed from the metrics like the quality of the software. It also relates to the cost that influences the metrics and budget of the project. Engineering artifacts are the artifacts that deal with the code and its execution and it also deals with the technical metrics like the effectiveness of the code, and how the software functions. These are about the management and engineering artifacts.",
      "marks": 6,
      "remark": "The student clearly explains why the elaboration phase is critical for architectural stability, emphasizing the design, division into components, and its role as the 'backbone' of the project. This part is well-covered. The description of management and engineering artifacts is also largely correct, linking management artifacts to productivity, time, budget, and quality, and engineering artifacts to code, execution, and technical effectiveness. The examples provided are relevant. The answer is comprehensive and accurate."

      "question": "Draw the basic structure of software architecture in modern era with suitable example. Mention the disadvantages of software architecture in technical perspective. [BL: Understand| CO: 4|Marks: 7]",
      "text": "The software architecture in the modern era is based on the microservices architecture because microservices architecture has many advantages and its fault tolerance makes it more robust and scalable. Instead of a monolithic architecture, microservices is the architecture where it divides into decoupled and smaller individual components that perform a specified task. So, we can make an incremental reliable product and scale up and integrate also with existing components for faster integration and quick development.\n\n[Diagram/Structure described in text]:\nUser Interface (Multiple)\nUnderstand Architecture\nUser Architecture\nProduct Architecture\nInfrastructure (SQL database, User)\nBackend (Product database, Product)\n\nThe example of modern era software architecture involves developing an app, where the backend provides the user with a beautiful UI for the users to interact. The process for browsing the items while adding them to cart, and the infrastructure handles all the concurrent users. Instead of building a monolithic backend from scratch, we integrate third-party APIs and make it simple, while also integrating reusable and open-source components to simplify the process. Thus, this is the basic structure of software architecture in the modern era. Software architecture affects the software project that its implementation should be constant to provide the basic guidelines and blueprints for the technical team to build the project. Although software architecture provides the guidelines for the technical team to build, it does have certain disadvantages from a technical perspective:\n\nDisadvantages of software architecture from a technical perspective:\n1. We know that the architecture is a rigid part, so changes cannot be made easily. Therefore, it is important to catch up with the current trends and implement necessary changes for technical teams.\n2. Architecture can become difficult to understand for new members.\n3. The architecture also allows a strict form of collaboration and forces the technical teams to follow it, which is rigid for teams.\n4. It doesn't take into account current available tools for the technical teams and doesn't utilize their expertise in a related project.\n\nThese are the disadvantages of software architecture from a technical perspective.",
      "marks": 5,
      "remark": "The student correctly identifies microservices as a key modern architectural style and describes its benefits (decoupled, scalable). The textual 'diagram' or component list is basic but attempts to illustrate the structure. The example of an app using APIs is relevant. However, the disadvantages listed are somewhat generic. While rigidity is a characteristic of *some* architecture practices, modern microservices aim to be flexible. 'Difficult to understand' and 'rigid for teams' are valid points but could be elaborated with specific technical challenges (e.g., distributed tracing, inter-service communication complexity, deployment overhead). The point about 'not taking into account current tools' is a weakness in *implementation* or *design*, rather than an inherent architectural disadvantage. The discussion on disadvantages could be more technically precise."

      "question": "Write a short notes on process instrumentation. Elaborate different metrics in software organization. [BL: Understand| CO: 5|Marks: 7]",
      "text": "Process instrumentation: It is the technique used to implement different metrics in a software project and to take subsequent instrumentation techniques to find out the most effective software scenarios. Process instrumentation deals with various different processes to find out and then examine the need for the effectiveness of the software project. These are broadly used for the improvement of the project process. This is about process instrumentation.\n\nIn software engineering, we implement different types of metrics to analyze and evaluate the software project. These metrics help us in analyzing and evaluating a software project and determine if the software is successful or not. The ones we need are:\n\n1.  **Size:** Determines the size of the project. It tells us about how big the project is. We can determine the complexity of the project with the help of the size metric as it determines how long a small or huge project is. It deals with the assignment of the developers in the project. That determines how the project will be assigned. If it involves a lot of different processes, then project will be big. This determines how the project is taking shape.\n\n2.  **Effort:** This metric is used in software engineering to determine the amount of effort it takes to complete the software. A project can be started and running for implementation or deployment. It measures the amount of effort and knowledge it took to make the project.\n\n3.  **Time:** This metric is important because it is used to measure the time it took to complete the project, and we can estimate the remaining completion time for the project. Time is used to tell how much time it took for the project and whether it completed before the deadline.\n\n4.  **Cost:** This is another important key attribute. It also determines which is the step to understand the amount of financial resources it took to invest in a project. It determines the overall user satisfaction and revenue. Cost metrics are used by organizations that help to determine a software project's success. It deals with issues and helps us to balance it with overall solutions. We can also determine the effectiveness of our project to ensure that the project addresses the problems and solves them in an efficient and effective way. These are the different metrics used in software engineering.",

      "remark": "The student provides a clear and concise explanation of process instrumentation, linking it to measuring and improving project processes. The elaboration of different metrics (Size, Effort, Time, Cost) is comprehensive and accurate. Each metric is well-defined and its purpose in evaluating a software project is explained.

      "question": "Discuss how management and quality indicators are used to assess project success? Differentiate between line-of-business and project organizations. [BL: Understand| CO: 5|Marks: 7]",
      "text": "Management and quality indicators are used to assess if our software project is successful. Management indicators are primarily used to assess the quality of a software project. Thus, management indicators like collaboration, communication etc., are used to assess the software project. These indicators will determine the final outcome of the quality of the project. They do not take into account the user's emotions, but rather the managerial objectives of our software project. For example, communication: when there is aligned communication among the team members, it leads to direct and improved collaboration between different teams. This leads to the quick exchange of ideas and ensures effective solutions that lead to better outcomes. This also enhances the quality of the software project, which leads to required user satisfaction and doesn't lead to many internal issues. Quality indicators are the indicators that assess the quality of our software project, like the defect count, the number of features used in the project, and the different algorithms. Quality indicators indicate the effectiveness of the code and its working, which leads to great overall success of the project. This is how management and quality indicators are used to assess the project success.\n\nProject organizations vs. Line-of-business organizations:\nLine-of-business organizations follow a rigid structure based on the hierarchy of the team members, where they are divided into different teams and there is little communication and collaboration, which is a silo system. Each team has their own specific goals and there is little scope for deviation from their strict guidelines. This leads to a less productive project organization. For a project, the members are selected from different teams and they collaborate from their starting point. They are collaborative and communicate more with team members. They are based on flexible approaches.",
      "marks": 6,
      "remark": "The student effectively discusses how management indicators (collaboration, communication) and quality indicators (defect count, features, algorithms) contribute to assessing project success. The explanation for each type of indicator is relevant and provides good examples. The differentiation between line-of-business and project organizations is also clear and accurate, highlighting the hierarchical, siloed nature of LOB versus the flexible, collaborative, cross-functional nature of project organizations. The answer is well-structured and covers all aspects of the question."

      "question": "What are the challenges and opportunities in future software project management? Explain modern project profiles. [BL: Understand| CO: 6|Marks: 7]",
      "text": "Software project management is the management that relies on the needs and trends of software architecture. It adapts to the software project. The future software project management relies heavily on the iterative approach, where it's based on continuous implementation of the software and continuous delivery of the project. In each iteration, we get feedback from the users and stakeholders, and we use it to implement and iterate. Therefore, there are more opportunities where the software project can be managed as a more iterative process to improve the effectiveness of software outcomes, where we improve the effectiveness of software project. Unlike conventional software where a project's management is rigid and inflexible, the future software project management can make the architecture more flexible and therefore more adaptive. The future software management is adaptive and we can easily extend and make changes due to the fact that it is more dynamic and adapts to the current needs and demands.\n\nBut with the opportunities also come challenges. Due to the iterative nature of future software project management, the software project may not be predictable and there are lots of reasons because predictable nature doesn't support the fact that we can analyze and evaluate the functionality of the project and also leads to project overruns. It also leads to slow development because of the iterative nature of the software management. It also looks at the user contributions and documents the management process. If the architecture is rigid, then it might not achieve technical stability. Modern project profiles are based on the metrics that check whether it satisfied the needs or not. These metrics can be used to determine if the project is up to standard by profiling the project. This is about modern project profiles and the challenges and opportunities in future software project management.",
      "marks": 5,
      "remark": "The student correctly identifies the iterative nature as central to future software project management and highlights both opportunities (flexibility, adaptiveness, continuous delivery) and challenges (predictability, slow development, technical stability if architecture is rigid). The explanation of modern project profiles is linked to metrics and profiling. However, the 'slow development' due to iterative nature is a misconception or poorly articulated; agile/iterative methods aim for *faster* delivery of value, even if overall project duration isn't perfectly predictable. The challenges could be elaborated more specifically (e.g., managing distributed teams, security in evolving systems, technical debt). Overall, a good understanding but with some nuances missing or misstated."

      "text": "An organization with modern management methods is an organization that relies on modern practices like agile, flexibility, and collaboration in a software project. These management methods are effective because unlike traditional management where it is rigid, these modern management methods are adaptive. They rely on collaboration and communication among different teams, and it is also non-hierarchical in nature. The management is very flexible and it is a more dramatic approach that evolves with the current trends.\n\nModern management methods are also based on the value-driven system, where its emphasis is not only on documentation but on creating a creative and quick feedback loop. It encourages collaboration among the different departments and also improves the communication, where it leads to value maximization. This leads to productive outcomes. It is flexible because it is not hierarchical in nature, where we can interact with our seniors and control the direction directly. Modern software engineering methods deal with real-time approaches, where we make sure outcomes are realistic and more real-time approaches. It follows ethical principles like iteration, where we always know the cost of the software and calculate the estimation based on user needs. It also uses structures that also ensure that the costs can be controlled because we build software on demand, and then we implement the estimation.\n\nIt also follows a pragmatic approach, which is the most common and effective approach where it estimates based on the amount of work to be done and the most optimistic approach. We also take into account the historical data available for future software engineering to be as effective as possible. These are the outcomes of software engineering, which differ from present software engineering, leading to a dynamic approach and scalability for our organization with modern management methods that follow these beneficial software economics.",
      "marks": 5,
      "remark": "The student provides a good description of modern management methods (agile, flexible, collaborative, non-hierarchical, value-driven, real-time feedback). This forms a solid basis for the 'organization with modern management methods' assumption. However, the explanation of 'next generation software economics' is mostly a re-statement of these modern management principles and pragmatic cost estimation. It doesn't clearly articulate *how* these methods specifically reshape software economics in the 'next generation' context beyond simply being more efficient or adaptive. It misses aspects like leveraging AI/ML, automation's impact on cost structures, outcomes-based funding, or shifting business models (e.g., SaaS, platform economics). The connection to future economics is implied but not explicitly explored in sufficient depth."

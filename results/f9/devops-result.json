      "question": "Explain the process of branching and merging in Git. What are the best practices for managing branches and resolving conflicts?",
      "text": "Git is a distributed version control system. These are various operations we perform like branching and merging. Git is a distributed version control system unlike SVN, which is centralized. Git also allows users to collaborate and each user can have their own copy. User A local copy, User B local copy, User C local copy. \n\nBranching: This is when we create a new repository branch. A branch is a copy into your local repository so that you can proceed and edit the code. Branching allows us to safely and easily add new features without disturbing the main repository. For example, if we are creating a new feature, we can edit the code (new branch) for new purposes on our local copy and then commit or add new operations. And so, without branching, we easily commit the changes, and it might break the application. Therefore, branching ensures minimum impact. \n\nMerging in Git means the process where we add our code or data to the central repository. For example, if we have some small changes and the project has a single process. For this, we need to test the changes and if it passes all the test cases. After successfully testing, we can then merge it with the central repository. There are several required strategies. This is the process in Git to merge. \n\nTo ensure a smooth and good process, we need to follow best practices for managing branches and resolving conflicts. To manage these branches, we need to delete all the inactive branches and store them in one place. Then, we need to state the objective of each branch so that it can be organized. And when the project gets bigger, we need to bundle all the branches together so they can interact and easily to manage. \n\nWith respect to resolving conflicts, we first need to identify where the conflict occurs and we also need to cause the conflict. Then, we need to diagnose it and follow the steps to resolve the conflict.",

      "remark": "Good explanation of branching and merging. Best practices for managing branches are relevant. Conflict resolution is mentioned but lacks specific Git commands or detailed steps beyond 'identify, diagnose, follow steps'."

      "question": "Your team is struggling with maintaining consistency in infrastructure configurations across multiple environments. How would you implement infrastructure as Code (IaC) to address this challenge?",
      "text": "If my team is stressed in managing and maintaining infrastructure configurations across multiple environments, I would implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to address this challenge. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a solution that provides an organized blueprint with all the necessary infrastructure in the form of code. These are no more need to develop and build, it provides the method and infrastructure across different environments. It ensures that the infrastructure stays consistent across multiple environments. These are suitable solutions that can help a team while they are struggling with maintaining consistent build and scaling of an application. It helps in developing but also maintaining consistency across multiple environments. To avoid such errors, we implement Infrastructure as Code to address the challenge. Such a solution is a good remedy for various reasons, including providing stable infrastructure configurations across different environments. It becomes so challenging if we don't implement Infrastructure as Code. The practice (IaC) discusses this problem by providing a team with the necessary infrastructure to build out applications, then without manual interaction. IaC also provides the infrastructure in the form of code which is easy to use for application development. It also ensures that the infrastructure maintains consistency across multiple different environments. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) also allows teams to easily scale, build, and maintain their applications. It also helps a lot in maintaining the different infrastructure configurations so that those configurations are ignorant to the different multiple environments. Therefore, we should implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to address it in a scalable way.",
      "marks": 7,
      "remark": "Excellent answer. The student clearly identifies the problem and explains how IaC addresses it by ensuring consistency, enabling automation, and facilitating scalability and maintenance across environments. The explanation of IaC as a 'blueprint in code' is fitting."

      "question": "Discuss the key architectural differences between SVN and Git. How do these differences impact the way teams use these tools for version control and collaboration?",
      "text": "SVN is Subversion, a centralized version control system, unlike Git, which is a distributed version control system. Both SVN and Git are version control systems but they serve different purposes because of fundamental differences. SVN is a centralized version control system. In SVN, the server is important, it controls all operations. In SVN, the user has to commit their changes to the centralized server. In SVN, there is no way for a user to work offline and all their tasks should be online. SVN also shows a single timeline which exists on a server. Therefore, this allows the user to have less control over the code. SVN doesn't work offline and all their tasks should be online. SVN also shows a single timeline which exists on a server. Therefore, this allows the user to have less control over the code. \n\nGit is also a version control system but it is distributed. Git is a distributed system where each user has their own copy of the repository. In Git, each user can commit their changes and can perform a number of operations even when they are offline. In Git, the collaboration is consistent, unlike SVN, which is outdated. Git works offline and it also works online compared to SVN. It also allows easier collaboration and encourages revising, collaborating if issues arise. It also creates a test of the application rigorously before merging and for making good changes so the main repository has the selective license. \n\nCentralized vs distributed: A single team means less for version control and collaboration. SVN is used to strictly control the development process and is used for low collaboration and is used for basic applications that don't require much changes. Git allows high collaboration for teams, where each team can commit their own code and their own operations. It also ensures stable and reliable version control.",
      "marks": 7,
      "remark": "A very comprehensive and clear discussion of the architectural differences between SVN and Git, focusing on centralized vs. distributed nature. The impact on team collaboration, offline capabilities, and control over code is well explained."

      "question": "A critical bug was introduced in the latest commit on the main branch. How would you use Git to identify the commit that introduced the bug and revert the changes?",
      "text": "If a critical bug is introduced in the latest commit on the main branch. It is a critical issue and it might disrupt the application. We must ensure that the change is reverted to maintain the stable application. We first need to implement automated logs that can identify and update the errors like the critical bug. And to the development team, they need to report the logs and the hardware. A critical bug needs to be tracked from the logs. The logs must be introduced, and we need to keep track of it with its perfect details. Since Git is a distributed version control system, we can easily track the logs. The commit that introduced the bug needs to be tracked back to the commits and the history made to the main branch. But before that, we need to shut down the servers. Before this, we also need to take advantage of the features for the application. After identifying the commit that introduced the bug, we can then go along with the steps. If there are any bugs, we can then work and fix them locally. We need to simultaneously work on all new releases with rigorous testing so that it doesn't cause any bugs or errors in the code. We need to soft reset the branch and revert the changes. We then need to perform the release operations with the full patch that was designed before the branch that introduced the critical bug in the main branch. Then we can easily eliminate the threat of a critical bug and we can easily ensure that these are high uptime. Then we can immediately solve the bug through reverting the critical commit. What I would do is git revert the commit that introduces the bug as it is very high.",
      "marks": 5,
      "remark": "The student correctly identifies 'git revert' as the solution for undoing changes. However, the process for *identifying* the commit is less specific to Git (e.g., `git bisect`, `git blame` are not mentioned), focusing more on general logging and tracking. The surrounding steps like shutting down servers and performing patch releases, while potentially part of a broader incident response, deviate from the Git-specific workflow requested."

      "question": "Your team is migrating an existing monolithic application to microservices architecture using docker containers. Outline the steps and considerations for breaking down the monolith into smaller, independently deployable containers.",
      "text": "Monolithic application is the type of application in which all the infrastructure is built on a single layer. This type of application is used for old type of environments. Monolithic applications are therefore easier to handle and maintain. It also requires less features for maintenance and is also used in old applications where there are less frequent collaborations and for less critical applications. But if the team needs to add some functionality to the application, we need more robust infrastructure and we need to add new features. A monolithic application does not allow such changes. Therefore, we introduce Infrastructure as Code and Docker containers, which will enable us to break down the key type of architecture. This is breakdown the monolithic application into smaller, individualized components. \n\nIn microservices architecture, we define the scope of each component and break down into smaller and individually deployable containers. In monolithic applications, if the application stops, if we remove it temporarily, it will not work. But in microservices architecture, smaller, individual components are unbundled and deployable. This is possible through Docker containers. With Docker, it provides a breakdown into small, independent components. \n\nWe need to containerize each individual component, then also its dependencies. Thus, we need to break the monolith into smaller and easily testable dependent containers. Then we make these containers to communicate with each other and with shared business logic and functional indications. Therefore, we test the application and deploy it when ready. These are some steps that I would take for breaking down the monolith into smaller, independently deployable containers, then the team would develop for individual monolithic application to microservices architecture using Docker containers.",

      "question": "Compare EC2 reserved instances, on-demand instances and spot instances in terms of pricing models, cost optimization strategies and use cases for each type.",
      "text": "EC2 or Elastic Compute Cloud is a service provided by Amazon Web Services that provides the cloud services. EC2 is a service where we use free tier instances and AWS provides cloud and server applications where we run our virtual machine on the cloud. We can temporarily purchase storage on the cloud. EC2 also provides different instances and also EC2 reserved instances, on-demand instances, and spot instances. \n\nEC2 Reserved instances are the type of instances provided by AWS where we purchase a minimum amount of instances. This mostly supports a budgeting model and also constant pricing. It is a beneficial solution, we select and then make reserved instances that are used when we can estimate the demand. The demand is constant when building the application. It is best used when the demand is sustained and stable. \n\nOn-demand instances are the type of instances provided by AWS where we can predict the demand for our application. In on-demand instances, there are a required number of instances and we can find some other changes based on the sudden increase. The pricing of the on-demand instances is very flexible. If there is demand for the application, it creates the instances for a short time. And then we can easily scale. But it is very beneficial when we need to scale and maintain our application over long numbers of copies or when we can easily purchase instances and scale. If we need to work with the servers and storage, spot instances can also be useful. \n\nSpot instances are the type of instances where we get the most cost-effective instances. We can easily the required instances and deploy them. This is a process that reduces the cost. These are the uses of EC2 instances: 1) Scale, 2) Our application, and 3) We scale the required instances for scaling our applications.",

The application and all its dependencies, therefore, different components of the applications can be containerized and broken down into deployable and dependent containers. These are some advantages of deploying applications in Docker containers. \n\nDocker simplifies the application, packaging dependencies, and deployment across different environments.

After conducting a test, the container is a robust, independent, and flexible step in this step. Application package to package different, individual components of Docker. This is the framework of the application for quick and smooth deployment. Therefore, it also helps in the infrastructure management because not all infrastructure containers are easily individualized. So using Docker containers, we can easily solve the dependencies of each component and their dependencies in containers. These are some advantages. \n\nSince the Docker container is a containerized and light unit, it doesn't need to depend on the environment, but it has its own ecosystem. Therefore, since it only depends on the Host OS, it can work across different environments.",

We need to go through those steps. We introduce one after another. We need to check the fundamental and key features of the application and check them one after another. Functional, performance, and security testing. For these key roles, for the manual, for such applications, this must be thorough. And it should be tested to ensure basic and optimal working. We need to check the edge cases and if it's working properly, also test the API calls and communication. After that, we assign different teams to different aspects of the application and gather feedback and make the necessary changes.

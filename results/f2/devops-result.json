      "question": "Explain the process of branching and merging in Git. What are the best practices for managing branches and resolving conflicts?",
      "text": "Branching and Merging: Process of where each data is divided into different sections. These sections contain all its related code in one place. These sections are called branches. There are multiple branches where each branch has the code. Merging is the process of converting collected different branches into the best processes for combining branches. It compiles thoroughly through its implemented lecture structure of code horizontally or vertically. Context Code. It's an application where coders/developers share ideas, problems and solutions. We can find ideas, works, theories, problems, solutions, and an example code for that problem. We can also refer to others to solve problems that are relevant. We can also see how others solved the problem. It is a community where everyone can learn. GitHub is used to collect and share ideas from others. It is all possible.",
      "marks": 3,
      "remark": "Student correctly defines branching and merging conceptually. However, it lacks specific best practices for managing branches (e.g., naming conventions, short-lived branches, feature branches) and completely misses how to resolve conflicts in Git. The latter part about GitHub and sharing ideas is too generic for the specific Git practices requested."

      "question": "Your team is struggling with maintaining consistency in infrastructure configurations across multiple environments. How would you implement infrastructure as Code (IaC) to address this challenge?",
      "text": "Explain Infrastructure as Code. One needs to follow these steps: 1) Monitor continuous deployment fresh code. You have to ensure implemented IaC (Infrastructure as Code) which helps the cells to spread across multiple environments. Deploy data. We explain it without collaborating for the steps: 1) One needs to create and deploy Docker containers to store data. 2) To manage data. 3) These data can be extracted. 4) We can manage containers in a way that it causes changes.",
      "marks": 1,
      "remark": "Student identifies IaC and correctly links it to consistency across environments. However, the proposed steps for implementing IaC immediately diverge into generic Docker container management, rather than explaining how IaC principles (e.g., version control for infrastructure definitions, declarative configuration, using specific IaC tools like Terraform, Ansible, Chef) would be applied to *address infrastructure configuration consistency*. The steps provided are not practical for IaC implementation."

      "question": "Discuss the key architectural differences between SVN and Git. How do these differences impact the way teams use these tools for version control and collaboration?",
      "text": "In developing real world projects, a team needs to help each other and look out for each other while developing real world projects. In large teams, there would be more quality checks, the project would be more verified and most importantly, the workload could be divided. Amount of work done by a person could be decided amongst team mates. It allows for quick personal work on the project. Some management is required. This is where different directories come into place. The most commonly used directories are: 1) SVN 2) Git. SVN: SVN uses a centralized architecture, which means lots of people who have access to the directory can make choices which would be reflected on actual code/product. This directory becomes a headache when multiple users are in use of the code. There is a lot of work. It is quite hard to test some test cases in architecture. Suddenly switching tools between the project is quite hard. Git: Git uses a decentralized architecture, which means when you use code, it equally clones the directory where you can work on your project and make changes on it (clone) without knowing that someone else can cause your idea. Git becomes easy when there are multiple users on your team and each has a unique idea. Oh yes, it goes without actually making changes on actual code. This makes more number of choices to choose one in which more users can get a valuable and efficient idea from all the ideas of team members before deploying it on the web. One can cooperatively get easily to switch tools for testing and can collaborate with other tasks easily. Git over all both technologies have their own advantages and disadvantages. It depends on the user's need and type. Users use which technology and prefer. Both have their own unique architectures. Both have their own use and disadvantages.",
      "marks": 6,
      "remark": "The student correctly identifies the key architectural difference between SVN (centralized) and Git (decentralized/distributed). They explain the impact on collaboration well, highlighting SVN's difficulties with multiple users and Git's ease of independent work through cloning. The answer demonstrates a strong understanding of how these architectures affect team workflows. It could be slightly more concise but the core points are well-articulated."

      "question": "A critical bug was introduced in the latest commit on the main branch. How would you use Git to identify the commit that introduced the bug and revert the changes?",
      "text": "A critical bug. It is preferred and should be thoroughly checked and remediated. First, we need to decide each one individually and check each branch individually. After checking if you find an error branch, then go to that branch and change the code into required segments. Also check each and every segments individually. You can use white box testing. After finding the error, go to the error. Now, run that branch individually and again check errors. If no errors are found, then go to another branch. Go to that branch, edit the code and run the code. After that, combine all the branches and run the code. It is a long process but it shows how each and every element of the code is checked. Git helps the developer update the parts, branches, code, and every required item. It also teaches a lesson for developers how to check the entire code for future projects. As the developer learns lessons, the code should be organized and comments are here, especially while loops and if-else statements.",
      "marks": 1,
      "remark": "The student provides a generic, manual approach to debugging and fixing a bug. It fails to mention specific Git commands or strategies for 'identifying the commit' (e.g., `git bisect`) and 'reverting the changes' (e.g., `git revert`). The mention of 'white box testing' is out of context for this specific Git task. The answer does not demonstrate how Git would be specifically leveraged for this scenario."

      "question": "Discuss the key components and architecture of docker, including docker engine, docker hub, docker images, containers, networks, and volumes.",
      "text": "Docker: Docker is a type of software which is used for several containers. These containers are used to switch services, e.g., micro-services or micro-architectures. Applications and microservices using Docker containers. These containers can also be used to deploy code. These containers can store data, etc. There are various components that are present in Docker. They are: Docker Engine, Docker Hub, Docker Images, Containers, Networks and Volumes. Docker Engine: The Docker Engine is actually the most important part of Docker. Here, the main code which does all the processes of Docker present and acts as a heart to the Docker. Docker Hub: Docker Hub is an important component of Docker. It stores all the data. We can also retrieve the stored data here. Docker Images: Docker can actually store images by using Docker images. One can store, transfer, and share images using Docker images. Containers: Containers are like filled data files. These files can be stored, transferred, and accessed anywhere. Containers in Docker. Networks and Volumes: Networks are a type of mechanism where Docker files/containers can be transferred. Volumes are collective containers/files present in Docker that are all stored together. Networks and volumes can save some storage space and access.",
      "marks": 7,
      "remark": "The student has correctly identified and provided a reasonable description for each key component of Docker as requested (Docker Engine, Docker Hub, Docker Images, Containers, Networks, and Volumes). The explanations, though sometimes simplified, capture the essence and purpose of each component."

      "question": "Your team is migrating an existing monolithic application to microservices architecture using docker containers. Outline the steps and considerations for breaking down the monolith into smaller, independently deployable containers.",
      "text": "Docker Containers are used to create or expand to micro-applications or micro-services architecture. It is robust. We need to follow certain steps: 1) We need to build Docker containers and store all the data. 2) Ensure all the data is broken down into smaller data files which are stored in containers. 3) Independently deploy these containers. We can use CI/CD (Continuous Deployment) and deployment state. These tools help reduce human intervention. Errors are reduced. The process is automated and consistent.",
      "marks": 2,
      "remark": "The answer correctly states the use of Docker containers for microservices and the goal of independent deployment. However, it fails to outline concrete steps or considerations for *breaking down the monolith*. The steps provided are generic (build containers, break down data, independently deploy) and do not address the complexities of decomposition (e.g., identifying services, managing data migration, inter-service communication, dealing with shared codebases, etc.). The mention of CI/CD is a deployment consideration, not a decomposition step."

      "question": "Discuss the process of creating and managing Chef cookbooks. Include the steps involved in writing recipes, defining attributes, and testing cookbooks before deployment.",
      "text": "We use cloud provisioning and configuration management to create and manage Chef cookbooks. We use cloud services like AWS (Amazon Web Services), EC2 and Azure for cloud storage and management. We use Docker to create various data attributes and test its cookbooks before deployment. We use CI/CD (Continuous Deployment) to automate the deployment process. We use automated deployment which helps to have less human intervention in projects. It is preferred because if there is human intervention, there would be bound to be errors while deploying. To successfully deploy, we use it to create and deploy a project. The process steps: Create a database, create an account. We use Docker containers for testing. We use various types. We delete all the unused checking. Handle it in Docker. We use different types of tests to test out cookbooks before deploying it. These different types of tests are: 1) White box testing: This type of testing is done to check the code and check for errors. The code is passed and checked by developers. 2) Black box testing: This type of testing is done to check the set inputs, whether the expected output matches the actual output. This type of testing is done by testers and can be automated using tools. 3) Grey Box testing: This type of test is a mix of both black box and white box testing. It includes both aspects.",
      "marks": 2,
      "remark": "The student broadly links Chef cookbooks to cloud provisioning and configuration management, and acknowledges the need for testing before deployment. However, it completely misses the specific steps for creating and managing cookbooks (e.g., knife cookbook create, using resources, handlers). It incorrectly associates Docker with creating attributes and gives irrelevant 'process steps' like 'Create a database, create an account'. While it correctly describes general testing types (White, Black, Grey Box), it doesn't mention Chef-specific testing tools like Test Kitchen or Foodcritic, which are crucial for cookbook testing."

      "text": "Chef plays an important role in cloud provisioning and configuration management. Chef manages the Chef cookbooks. Chef involves writing recipes, defining attributes, and testing cookbooks before deployment. Chef uses automated testing tools. It helps in automated regression testing to ensure consistent and faster tests. Chef uses tools like CI/CD (Continuous Deployment) to make the process of deployment verified and faster. It ensures consistent across environments for deployment. Deployment tools. Deploy data to server.",
      "marks": 5,
      "remark": "The student correctly identifies Chef's role in cloud provisioning and configuration management and its function of managing cookbooks, recipes, attributes, and testing. It also correctly states that Chef ensures consistency across environments and contributes to automation. However, the explanation of *how* Chef automates infrastructure deployment (e.g., Chef client, convergence) is brief and relies heavily on linking it with CI/CD rather than detailing Chef's inherent automation capabilities."

      "question": "Outline the process of creating a manual test plan for a complex web application. What key elements should be included, and how would you ensure the plan is thorough and effective?",
      "text": "For a manual test plan for complex web applications, to ensure that test cases are passed and considered during real-time collaboration, all test cases, some of the key elements include: various [types of testing]: 1) Black box testing, 2) White box testing, 3) Grey Box testing, 4) UI testing. 1) Black box testing: This type of testing is done by the tester. It does this test which would ensure all test cases are passed. In this test, test cases needed to be checked are by the developer. This type of testing mostly checks the outputs of the code for a given input. 2) White box testing: This type of testing is done by the code developer. In this test, it should ensure that the code is error-free. The errors in the code (like logical error, syntax error) are checked and corrected by the developer. 3) Grey box testing: This type of testing can be done by developer or by tester. In this testing, it uses the best for both, i.e., black box and white box testing. UI testing: This type of testing is done by the tester. In this testing, each and every UI component is checked. This testing ensures the proper working of UI elements. The CSS style of web application is checked.",
      "marks": 3,
      "remark": "The student correctly identifies various types of testing (Black Box, White Box, Grey Box, UI testing) as 'key elements' that would be part of a comprehensive test plan's strategy. The descriptions of these testing types are reasonable. However, the answer completely misses outlining the *process* of creating a test plan (e.g., scope, objectives, environment, roles, schedule, risks, exit criteria) and other critical elements of the *plan document* itself, focusing solely on test methodologies. It does not adequately explain *how* to ensure thoroughness and effectiveness beyond listing test types."

      "question": "How would you develop a comprehensive test plan to ensure full coverage of a new feature in your application, including edge cases and potential failure points?",
      "text": "Create a Comprehensive Test Plan. To ensure full coverage of a new feature in your application and your app works in various ways: 1) Unit test, 2) Integration test, 3) UI test: This is a type of test which checks each and every element individually. 2) Integration test: This type of test checks whether each and every component of an application is properly connected to one another. It helps reduce errors and have consistent work. 3) Automated Regression tests. 4) UI test: This testing checks each of UI component, and checks each and every element for errors. Overall, all tests include: Black box testing and White box testing. Black box testing checks the outputs for the given inputs in the code of the web. It checks test cases. White box testing: This type of testing checks for errors present. This testing is also called internal testing. This is for developers.",
      "marks": 3,
      "remark": "Similar to 7.a, the student lists various types of testing (Unit, Integration, UI, Automated Regression, Black Box, White Box) which are relevant for achieving 'full coverage'. However, the answer does not outline a development process for the test plan and, crucially, lacks specific strategies for identifying and testing 'edge cases' and 'potential failure points' (e.g., boundary value analysis, negative testing, fault injection, performance testing). It primarily repeats definitions of test types rather than detailing how to specifically ensure comprehensive coverage for a *new feature* including complex scenarios."

      "question": "Write about hard skills and soft skills and mention the significance of soft skills for the engineering students. [BL: Understand| CO: 1|Marks: 7]",
      "text": "Hard skills and soft skills play a very important role in a student's life. These are the skills that every student must have. Having complete knowledge of these skills makes a student close to a perfect person. Let's talk about them in detail individually.\n\n**Hard Skills:** Hard skills are skills that are purely based on technical knowledge. Using these skills can be mastered in one's field. These skills are learned skills; one can easily master these types of skills. Most people can easily master these skills. Almost everyone can master these skills. One can use these skills to earn money. If everyone masters skills of these, at that point, society will be regarded as a developed society.\nExamples of these skills are:\n1) Coding\n2) Playing sports\n\n**Soft Skills:** Soft skills are also one of the most important skills to survive in today's society. These are the types of skills that one cannot learn. One needs personal skills, or one can use these skills correctly in each and every workplace and in numerous interviews. These skills show how one manages and copes with others, how one learns to be a good person, and how one can influence others. These skills include:\n1) Interpersonal Communication\nCommunication can be done verbally or non-verbally, or one can communicate using body language.\n\nFor an engineering student, one needs to have both these skills. One needs hard skills to understand and learn about the topic, and one needs them to solve problems, etc. One also needs soft skills to understand the effect of the problem, how one activates the tone and understands what the receiver has perceived, and how they interpret the message.\n\nOne also needs hard skills to clear external rounds like C++ (Technical Round) where companies check technical knowledge of the students. One needs soft skills to clear external rounds like HR (Human Resources) round, group discussion, etc. Here, the company checks how one interacted with others and how one communicated.",
      "marks": 6,
      "remark": "Good definitions and examples for both hard and soft skills. Significance for engineering students is also covered adequately. Deduction for minor grammatical errors and slight repetition."

      "question": "“We never get a second chance to make the first impression.” Do you agree or disagree? Why? Support this statement with an example. [BL: Apply| CO: 1|Marks: 7]",
      "text": "Yes, I agree with this statement because, as is known, 'the first impression is the best impression.' This means one has to convince the other person to make a positive impression on them. Approximately, one takes the first chance like 'winning a million dollars' or 'winning the cash prize.' This forms a solid opinion of a person. The other person will give their full attention just to that person or thing. Yes, one absolutely cannot be awarded a second chance. The first impression is the opposite. The opposite person has already had a strong opinion on during that previous encounter. You will not be given a second chance to prove yourself.",
      "marks": 5,
      "remark": "Agrees and provides a reasonable explanation connecting to forming solid opinions. The example given is a bit abstract ('winning a million dollars') and doesn't fully demonstrate 'making a first impression' in a social or professional context. Minor issues with clarity in reasoning towards the end."

      "question": "Describe with examples the self-fulfillment and happiness of productive interpersonal communication skills. When will we be able to tell if it worked? [BL: Understand| CO: 2|Marks: 7]",
      "text": "Productive interpersonal communication skills are observed when:\n1) When everyone understood the message delivered by the speaker.\n2) When the audience receives and responds to the speaker positively.\n3) When the crowd asks questions or speaks after the speaker.\n4) When the students interact.\n5) When the crowd acknowledges and accepts the conversation.\nSelf-fulfillment is observed when the speaker is heard and there is happiness in the speaker's eyes. In short, observe this when the company asks for feedback from the speaker and audience, and they express their views without any disturbances. And how the audience understood the speaker. One can easily tell if the crowd understood it just by asking questions. The crowd also gives positive feedback for the speech.",
      "marks": 4,
      "remark": "The student addresses 'When will we be able to tell if it worked?' quite well by listing indicators of effective communication and audience engagement. However, the 'self-fulfillment and happiness' aspect of productive communication is not fully described with examples. It only states 'Self-fulfillment is observed when the speaker is heard and there is happiness in the speaker's eyes', which is a consequence, not a description of the 'self-fulfillment and happiness' itself. The answer lacks the descriptive aspect of the prompt's first part."

      "question": "Prepare a conversation between you and the principal of your college asking him permission to participate in sports at a state level competition and also you may not be able to attend the classes for one week. For that reason, you have to convince him to provide attendance for one week. [BL: Apply| CO: 2|Marks: 7]",
      "text": "Me: A very good morning Sir, may I come in?\nPrincipal: Yes, please come in. What's the matter?\nMe: Sir, I could not attend the classes for one week. Sir, I would like to request permission to draw your approval regarding this matter.\nPrincipal: Okay, do you need permission?\nMe: Sir, there is an upcoming sports tournament coming this week. From June 4th to June 7th, I would like to participate in that tournament to represent our college. What about how you prepare for this tournament, as there are tournaments coming for you for the month of September?\nPrincipal: Which state-level tournament are you talking about?\nMe: Sir, there is a state-level tournament organized by Athletic Federation. I am one of the selected participants to represent our college.\nPrincipal: Here are students coming from various states and colleges across India for this tournament. The students who got medals will be awarded, and they represent our college. Okay, I will approve you for this tournament.\nMe: Sir, I would like to request to grant me permission for practice for this tournament.\nPrincipal: But what about the studies?\nMe: Sir, I will make up on studies after the tournament. Please grant me leave and provide attendance for one week. So, I will get approval for my request. Can you also give a letter of approval for the tournament?\nPrincipal: Okay, thank you. I will approve your leave, but try your level best.\nMe: Okay Sir, I will take my leave.",
      "marks": 6,
      "remark": "The conversation structure is good, and the student's requests are clearly articulated. The principal's responses are also realistic. The student successfully addresses both permission for the tournament and attendance for the week. Minor awkward phrasing in some lines ('What about how you prepare for this tournament, as there are tournaments coming for you for the month of September?' - this line from Principal sounds a bit off). The conclusion is a bit abrupt."

      "question": "Interpret the importance of learning speech sounds of english language for fluent and confident communication. Why is the lack of the aforementioned a problem? [BL: Understand| CO: 4|Marks: 7]",
      "text": "Learning speech sounds of English language is very important. It helps one to be fluent, confident, and communicate excellently. For example, speech sounds of 'cold' versus 'gold'. If one pronounces the word out loud, one would feel the difference. Learning speech sounds helps the person to speak clearly and more excellently. It helps one to convert their doubt into confidence, like 'What is it?' or 'It is not what it is'. Learning speech sounds helps to stress on words or syllables. It helps to explain the meaning of speech sound, and the meaning can be completely clear. Knowing before speech affects the speech sound, but the tone of the speech also plays a very important role. It is believed that the tone of a person also affects the result of proper delivery of the message. If the tone of the message is high, then the message is understood quickly. If the meaning of the message is understood completely, then the tone is also conveyed correctly.\n\nLack of proper speech sounds makes a message unclear or the message gets misinterpreted. Lack of perfect tone is also a problem because tone plays a very important role in the user's delivery of the message. It helps the message to be understood as sensible or nonsense. A low tone changes the true meaning of the message, such that it portrays a different message to the listener, and the listener perceives it as a different tone.",
      "marks": 6,
      "remark": "Good interpretation of the importance of speech sounds, including fluency, confidence, and clarity, with relevant examples ('cold' vs 'gold'). The explanation of how tone affects communication is also well-integrated. The second part, 'Why is the lack of the aforementioned a problem?', is also adequately addressed by explaining how lack of proper speech and tone leads to misinterpretation and unclear messages. Minor grammatical issues."

      "question": "What is mother tongue influence? Throw light on a few examples from your mother tongue that influences the spoken communication. [BL: Apply| CO: 4|Marks: 7]",
      "text": "English is the most spoken language and one of the most used languages in the world. Nowadays, almost everyone uses English language for communication on the entire planet. Here, the user has to be familiar with the language. But the good pronunciation of words varies very differently from place to place. It may be because of the influence of the local language. This phenomenon is also known as Mother Tongue Influence. Mother Tongue Influence does not only rely on the knowledge and skills a person has. It means that the person has less spoken language.\n\nMother Tongue Influence means the influence of the native language (local language) spoken over the speech sounds that are generally used in that language and how the language influences the pronunciation of words taken from the same person. For example, 'stop' versus 'sport'.\n\nIt is also observed that most of the spoken language is Hindi. But the language spoken by people in Maharashtra is different from the language spoken by Telangana people. It is because the Marathi language has an influence on people in Maharashtra. The languages Telugu and Urdu have an influence on the Hindi speech of people there.\n\nLet's take another example. Let's see how 'Color' (British English) and 'Colour' (US English) are both the same language, but the tone, pronunciations, and some spellings are different. For example, 'Royal complete red' or 'red'.\nUS English: Color, Use\nBritish English: Colour, Use",
      "marks": 5,
      "remark": "Defines mother tongue influence (MTI) reasonably well. Provides good examples of regional variation in India (Maharashtra vs. Telangana) and the influence of local languages (Marathi, Telugu, Urdu) on Hindi speech, which directly addresses the prompt's request for examples from 'your mother tongue that influences spoken communication' (interpreting 'your mother tongue' as a general regional context rather than a specific individual's). The British vs. American English example for 'color/colour' is a good illustration of dialectal differences, though not strictly MTI unless framed as a learner from a non-English speaking background being influenced by their native language *in how they pronounce* one of these. The example for 'stop' vs 'sport' to show pronunciation differences is also relevant. The beginning talks about general English usage, which is preamble, not direct answer. Clarity could be improved in some parts."

      "question": "Elaborate upon the stress management mechanism. Explain the way of measuring the stress. [BL: Understand| CO: 5|Marks: 7]",
      "text": "Stress is a very important topic for stress management. Stress is the pressure a person feels when the person is handed a task but is not given enough time or resources to complete the task. There are many different types of stress:\n1) Physical stress\n2) Mental stress\n\n**Physical Stress:** It is a type of stress that puts a lot of pressure on a human body. One can usually see this stress when the human body is pushed to its limits. Most people who work regularly encounter this stress, for example, encountering stress while building the body to its resistance or to its best work. Most old-age people also encounter this stress.\n\n**Mental Stress:** It is also a type of stress that creates a lot of pressure in a human brain. Most of the work done is done in the brain. One can encounter this stress when one overloads the brain with a lot of pressure without any break. Students also encounter this type of stress in their life or during exams. This stress can lead to problems. This stress also takes away sleep, and one would keep thinking about how to clear this stress. This stress affects the body in many ways.",
      "marks": 4,
      "remark": "Elaborates on stress well, defining it and categorizing it into physical and mental stress with relevant examples. However, the question also asks about the 'stress management mechanism' and 'the way of measuring the stress,' which are largely missing from this answer. The student only describes types and impacts of stress, not how to manage or measure it. The latter part of this answer, 'ways of developing the body language,' is part of Q6.a and has been moved to that section for evaluation."

      "question": "Write a short note on the impact of stress. Describe in detail the ways of developing the body language. [BL: Understand| CO: 5|Marks: 7]",
      "text": "**Impact of Stress:** Stress affects the body in many ways. For example, lack of sleep, continuous thinking about how to clear this stress, leading to problems. Stress can lead to health issues.\n\n**Ways of developing body language:** There are different ways to develop good body language. One can develop body language without any hesitation. Try to develop it, and do not think about what others think or say.\n\n1) **Dance:** Dance is one of the best ways to improve your body language. There are various dance forms which not only improve our body language but also improve our correct movements. As you know, how to react to each situation also relaxes your body. This helps to relax your body. It helps to control your body and mind.\n\n2) **Practice:** Practice before delivering a speech makes the speech good. It shows how practice takes one to perfection. When you slowly talk to yourself without any mirror, you can see yourself.\n\n3) **Walking:** Walking also gives you confidence. You can see how one walks in front of the camera, clear and confident, without any mistakes.",
      "marks": 5,
      "remark": "The 'impact of stress' is briefly noted, but could be more detailed, as it's a specific part of the question. The 'ways of developing body language' is well-answered with specific, actionable points like dance, practice, and walking, and explanations for each. This part was found mixed with Q5.a in the original OCR. Credit for this portion is given here. The discussion on body language is quite good, but the impact of stress is very brief."

      "question": "Analyze the role of a leader and a facilitator in a group discussion. How do they influence group dynamics and outcomes? [BL: Understand| CO: 5|Marks: 7]",
      "text": "A leader and a facilitator in a group discussion perform various roles. They have two different roles.\n\n**Leader:** The one who encourages the team and lets the team have a positive vision. A true leader is one who puts the team before himself. The leader needs more love and respect from the team. The leader takes the responsibility for success or failure. A true leader takes all the blame on himself if the team fails.\n\n**Facilitator:** The one who listens to each and every member of the team. The facilitator accommodates team members and assigns tasks to them. The facilitator knows what they are good at. The facilitator encourages the members of the team and makes sure that the group task is completed. And it is done by a group of team members.",
      "marks": 5,
      "remark": "The student differentiates the roles of leader and facilitator clearly, highlighting their core responsibilities. The description of a leader focuses on inspiration, responsibility, and taking blame. The description of a facilitator focuses on listening, task assignment, and ensuring completion. Both roles influence group dynamics by guiding participation and task management. However, the 'How do they influence group dynamics and outcomes?' aspect could be more explicitly elaborated beyond just describing their functions. For instance, a leader's encouragement improves morale, a facilitator's task assignment ensures efficiency. Some depth is missing in connecting the roles to direct influence on dynamics and outcomes."

      "question": "Differentiate between report writing and essay writing. Explain with examples. [BL: Understand| CO: 6|Marks: 7]",
      "text": "Report writing helps one to tell people about a specific incident. It tells the people about the full information regarding the incident. Report writing uses a specific format. The format includes the title, body, conclusion, and signature of the reporter. This type of writing usually reports a specific issue that has already occurred or happened. This informs the readers about the issue and the solution regarding the issue. It also includes the information related to the people involved in the incident. There is a specific format for report writing.\n\nEssay writing helps one to give general knowledge about the topic. It also helps to describe the information. An essay has an introduction, body, and conclusion. These are followed by topics. It helps to explain one's view and knowledge about the topic.",
      "marks": 4,
      "remark": "Provides a basic differentiation between report writing and essay writing. It correctly identifies key structural elements (title, body, conclusion) for both and their general purpose (reporting incidents vs. general knowledge/description). However, the differentiation lacks depth. It doesn't clearly highlight the formal/informal aspects, objective/subjective nature, or different types of reports/essays. Examples beyond mentioning structural parts are missing. More specific comparative points would improve the answer."

      "question": "“Opening lines are important in letters”. Write one example each for different opening lines of letters. [BL: Apply| CO: 6|Marks: 7]",
      "text": "Opening lines are important in letters because the opening lines are preferred to be more important for letters. If the opening lines are good, formal letters develop more interest. Opening lines are very much respected.\n\n**1) Formal Letter:** Dear Rahul,\n**2) Casual Letter:** Hey Rajesh,\n**3) Email Letter:** Hi, how are you?\n**4) Reply Letter:** Dear Sir,\n**5) Resignation Letter:** Respected Manager,",
      "marks": 5,
      "remark": "The student correctly states the importance of opening lines. The examples provided for different types of letters are generally appropriate. However, 'Email Letter: Hi, how are you?' is a very informal opening for a general 'email letter' type (emails can be formal/informal). 'Reply Letter: Dear Sir,' is generic and could be any formal letter, not specific to a 'reply'. A better example for a reply letter might be 'Thank you for your letter of...' or 'In response to your inquiry...'. The question asked for 'one example *each* for different opening lines *of letters*', and email is a medium, not a type of letter. But given the context, it's an acceptable interpretation. Minor deductions for the slightly generic nature of some examples and the 'email letter' category."
